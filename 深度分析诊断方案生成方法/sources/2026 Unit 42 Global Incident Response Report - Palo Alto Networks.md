## Executive Summary

We see four major trends that will shape the threat landscape for 2026.

* **First, AI has become a force multiplier for threat
  actors.** It compresses the attack lifecycle, from access
  to impact, while introducing new vectors. This speed shift is
  measurable: in 2025, exfiltration speeds for the fastest attacks
  quadrupled.
* **Second, identity has become the most reliable path to
  attacker success.** Identity weaknesses played a material
  role in almost 90% of Unit 42 investigations. Attackers
  increasingly “log in” with stolen credentials and tokens,
  exploiting fragmented identity estates to escalate privileges
  and move laterally.
* **Third, software supply chain risk has expanded beyond
  vulnerable code to the misuse of trusted connectivity.** 
  Attackers exploit software-as-a-service (SaaS) integrations,
  vendor tools and application dependencies to bypass perimeters
  at scale. This shifts the impact from isolated compromise to
  widespread operational disruption.
* **Fourth, nation-state actors are adapting stealth and
  persistence tactics to modern enterprise operating
  environments.** These actors increasingly rely on
  persona-driven infiltration (fake employment, synthetic
  identities) and deeper compromise of core infrastructure and
  virtualization platforms, with early signs of AI-enabled
  tradecraft used to reinforce these footholds.

While these four trends each present a challenge, **attacker success is
rarely determined by a single attack vector.** In more than 750
incident response (IR) engagements, 87% of intrusions involved activity
across multiple attack surfaces. This means defenders must protect
endpoints, networks, cloud infrastructure, SaaS applications and
identity together. Further, nearly half (48%) involved browser-based
activity, reflecting how often attacks intersect with routine workflows
like email, web access and day-to-day SaaS usage.

**Most breaches were enabled by exposure, not attacker
sophistication.** In fact, in over 90% of breaches, preventable
gaps materially enabled the intrusion: limited visibility,
inconsistently applied controls, or excessive identity trust. These
conditions delayed detection, created paths for lateral movement, and
increased impact once attackers obtained access.

**Security leaders must close the gaps attackers rely on.** First,
reduce exposure by securing the application ecosystem, including
third-party dependencies and integrations, and hardening the browser,
where many intrusions now begin. In parallel, reduce area of impact by
advancing zero trust and tightening identity and access management (IAM)
to remove excessive trust and limit lateral movement. Finally, as the
last line of defense, ensure the security operations center (SOC) can
detect and contain threats at machine speed by consolidating telemetry
and automating response.

## 1. Introduction

In 2025, Unit 42 responded to more than 750 major cyber incidents. Our
teams worked with large organizations facing extortion, network
intrusions, data theft and advanced persistent threats. Targets spanned
every major industry and more than 50 countries. In each case, the
situation had escalated to the point where the SOC called for backup.

When that call comes, our incident responders move quickly to
investigate, contain and eradicate the threat. We help organizations
establish what happened, restore operations, and reduce the risk of
recurrence by strengthening controls, visibility and resilience.

Each intrusion tells a story: what the attacker targeted, how they
gained access, how the activity escalated and what could have stopped it
sooner. In the aggregate, these stories become trends and provide
insight into the global threat landscape. They show what’s changing in
adversary tradecraft, the repeated mistakes organizations make, and most
importantly, what defenders can do to keep their organizations safe.
This report distills those lessons.

Over the past year, attack speeds continued to accelerate. Attackers are
still early in their adoption of AI-enabled tradecraft, but its impact
is already visible. AI reduces friction across reconnaissance, social
engineering, scripting, troubleshooting and extortion operations. It
enables greater scale and the ability to launch multiple attacks
simultaneously. The result is a shrinking window for detection and
containment, where what happens in the first minutes after initial
access can determine whether an incident becomes a breach.

At the same time, most breaches still follow familiar paths. And that is
why our most important conclusion remains unchanged: security is
solvable. In more than 90% of incidents, misconfigurations or lapses in
security coverage materially enabled the intrusion. Attackers are
adapting, but they most often succeed by exploiting preventable gaps —
inconsistent control deployment, incomplete telemetry, over-permissive
identity trust and unmanaged third-party connectivity across SaaS and
cloud.

This report is organized as a practical guide to the current threat
landscape:

* **Emerging threats and trends:** How attacker tradecraft is
  evolving — AI as a force multiplier, identity as the most
  reliable path to success, expanding software supply chain risk
  through trusted connectivity and evolving nation-state tactics.
* **Inside the intrusion:** An aggregate view of observed
  tactics, techniques and procedures across Unit 42 investigations
  — what attackers target, how they get in, how fast they move and
  the impacts they drive.
* **Recommendations for defenders:** Concrete steps to close
  the gaps that enable compromise, constrain area of impact, and
  build response capability fast enough to stop incidents before
  they escalate.

Unit 42 operates 24/7 to protect the digital world from cyberthreats. The
goal of this report is straightforward: to turn what we learn on the
front lines into decisions that stop incidents before they become
breaches.

## 2. Emerging Threats and Trends

### Trend 1. AI Has Become a Force Multiplier for Attackers

AI is changing the economics of intrusions. It increases attacker
speed, scale and effectiveness while opening entirely new attack
vectors.

While much of this activity occurs on adversary infrastructure —
beyond our ability to directly observe — Unit 42 investigations and
research reveal a clear shift.
In 2025, threat actors moved from experimentation to routine
operational use. AI is not an attacker “easy button,” but it is a
massive friction reducer. It allows threat actors to move faster,
iterate more frequently, and operate with fewer human constraints.

## AI Increases the Speed and Scale of Attacks

AI compresses the attack lifecycle and reduces the manual effort
required to operate across multiple targets.

**Faster vulnerability exploitation:** The window between
disclosure and exploitation continues to shrink. Threat actors are
automating the “monitor → diff → test → weaponize” loop.
[Unit
42 research](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2022/12/active-attack-surface-management-with-cortex-xpanse/) found that attackers start scanning for newly
discovered vulnerabilities within 15 minutes of a CVE being
announced. Exploitation attempts often begin before many security
teams have even finished reading the vulnerability advisory.

**Parallelized targeting:** Operator time is less of a
constraint. AI-assisted workflows allow actors to run reconnaissance
and initial access attempts across hundreds of targets in parallel,
and then concentrate effort where they find a weak signal.

**Ransomware at scale:** We see actors using AI to reduce manual
work during deployment (script generation, templating) and extortion
(messaging consistency). The shift is not that ransomware is new, it
is that the **operator time required to run it at scale is
dropping.**

Ransomware Automation

In a ransomware investigation, Unit 42 recovered operational
scripts used to deploy payloads, coordinate lateral movement
and impair security controls at scale. Several elements were
consistent with AI-assisted development, including unusually
thorough commenting, templated variants and
efficiency-focused fallback logic. The net effect was
machine-like execution across hundreds of systems,
compressing the time and effort typically required to stage
a multi-phase deployment.

The AI Negotiator

In an extortion case, Unit 42 negotiators observed responses
that were unusually consistent in tone, grammar, cadence and
turnaround time across exchanges. These patterns are
consistent with templated or AI-assisted messaging. Even
partial automation matters: it enables actors to run more
concurrent negotiations and apply more disciplined pressure,
without tying up a human operator on every thread.

**What this means in time-to-impact:** Last year, [Unit
42 simulated](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2025/02/incident-response-report-attacks-shift-disruption/) an AI-assisted attack that reduced
time-to-exfiltration down to 25 minutes. Real-world IR data reflects
this acceleration: the fastest 25% of intrusions reached exfiltration in
1.2 hours, down from 4.8 hours the calendar year prior.

## AI Improves Attacker Outcomes

AI is raising the success rate of known attack techniques.

**Hyper-personalized social engineering:** We have moved past
“phishing with better grammar.” Actors can automate open-source
intelligence (OSINT) collection, including professional and
organizational context, to craft lures that match the target’s role
and relationships.

**Synthetic identities:** Threat actors like [Muddled
Libra](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-actor-groups-tracked-by-palo-alto-networks-unit-42/) and [North
Korean IT workers](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-synthetic-identity-creation/) increasingly use deepfake techniques to
steal credentials and pass remote hiring workflows.

**Malware development:** In the [Shai-Hulud](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/npm-supply-chain-attack/)
campaign, Unit 42 assessed that attackers used a large language
model (LLM) to generate malicious scripts.

**Lowered barrier to entry:** Purpose-built malicious LLMs and
jailbreak attacks continue to reduce the skill required to produce
persuasive lures and functional code variants. The net effect is
that more actors are able to execute credible tradecraft faster,
with fewer mistakes.

“Vibe Extortion”

An unsophisticated actor exfiltrated sensitive data but had
no plan for the shakedown. To bridge the gap, they used an
LLM to script a professional extortion strategy, complete
with deadlines and pressure tactics. The result was surreal:
The actor recorded a threat video from their bed while
visibly intoxicated, reading the AI-generated script
word-for-word from a screen. The threat lacked technical
depth, but the model supplied coherence. AI didn’t make the
attacker smarter; it just made them look professional enough
to be dangerous.

**Bottom line:** AI improves the attackers’ rates of success at each
stage. It improves the quality of lures, shortens the time needed to
adapt tools and reduces dependence on constant operator intervention,
making extortion more consistent and scalable.

## AI Creates New Attack Vectors

Enterprise AI adoption creates a new class of risk: Living off the
AI land (LOTAIL). Just as attackers misuse PowerShell or Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI), they are now weaponizing
legitimate AI platforms and embedded assistants.

**Turning your AI platform into a weapon:** Threat actors use
valid credentials to misuse enterprise AI platforms. For example,
recent [Unit
42 research on Google Vertex AI](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/privilege-escalation-llm-model-exfil-vertex-ai/) demonstrated how attackers
could misuse custom job permissions to escalate privileges and use a
malicious model as a Trojan horse to exfiltrate proprietary data.

**The attacker’s co-pilot:** With compromised credentials, an
intruder can use an internal assistant to pull context at machine
speed, including requesting integration guides, admin runbooks or
network maps. The assistant becomes a force multiplier, allowing
intruders to understand the environment with fewer mistakes.

The AI-Assisted Insider

An insider weaponized their company’s own AI assistant to
stage an attack. Forensic analysis showed the insider used
the tool to research internal systems, generate a custom
denial-of-service (DoS) script and troubleshoot errors in
real time. The assistant bridged a skill gap, enabling the
actor to target core infrastructure they likely could not
have operated against as effectively without AI support.

**The risk is clear:** if a tool can help employees get work done, it
can also help intruders understand your environment and move with fewer
mistakes.

## Countermeasures: Defending Against AI-Driven Threats

These tactics will help you defend against AI-assisted attacks:

**Counter AI-accelerated attack speed**

* **Automate external patching:** Mandate
  automated patching for critical CVEs on internet-facing assets
  to close the 24-hour exploitation window.
* **Autonomous containment:** Deploy AI-driven
  response to drive down mean time to detect/respond (MTTD/MTTR)
  and isolate threats before they can automate lateral movement.

**Defend against improved tradecraft**

* **Behavioral email security:** Transition
  from signature-based filters to engines that identify anomalies
  in communication patterns.
* **Intent-based awareness:** Move beyond
  simply training employees to spot typos. Shift to out-of-band
  (OOB) verification for all sensitive requests (e.g., wire
  transfers, credential resets or remote hiring).

**Protect the AI attack surface**

* **Monitor model telemetry:** Correlate
  unusual AI API calls or scripts sourced from model outputs with
  known evasion techniques.
* **Prompt visibility:** Alert on sensitive
  queries to internal LLMs (e.g., “find all passwords”) and
  enforce strict permission boundaries for tokens and service
  accounts.

### Trend 2. Identity Is the Most Reliable Path to Attacker Success

In the past year, identity weaknesses played a material role in
nearly 90% of the investigations Unit 42 handled. In our caseload,
identity shaped intrusions end to end. It served as the way in, the
path to privilege escalation and the mechanism for lateral movement
using valid access.

As organizations move deeper into SaaS, cloud and hybrid
environments, the network perimeter matters less. Identity — the
linkage between users, machines, services and data — has become the
practical perimeter. In many cases, threat actors don’t need a
sophisticated exploit chain. They log in with stolen credentials,
hijacked sessions or mis-scoped privileges.

Authenticated access changes the dynamics of an intrusion. It lets
adversaries move faster, blend into normal activity and expand their
area of impact with fewer obstacles. This trend is accelerating as
machine identities, embedded AI applications and fragmented identity
estates expand the number of access paths attackers can exploit.

## The Way In: Identity-Driven Initial Access

Unit 42 case data shows that 65% of initial access is driven by
identity-based techniques. While defenders focus on patching
vulnerabilities, threat actors often bypass software controls by
targeting users and authentication paths.

We see the following primary routes to initial access:

* **Identity-related social engineering
  (33%):** Identity-based phishing (22%) and other social
  engineering (11%) remain the leading drivers of modern breaches.
  Rather than simple credential theft, these tactics increasingly
  focus on multi-factor authentication (MFA) circumvention and
  session hijacking, allowing attackers to bypass authentication
  controls and move laterally by exploiting trusted identity
  workflows.
* **Credential misuse and brute force (21%):**
  Previously compromised credentials (13%) and brute force
  activity (8%) allow attackers to gain access with little
  interaction. By using valid accounts obtained from prior
  breaches or underground markets, actors log directly into
  virtual private networks (VPNs), remote access gateways and
  cloud portals, bypassing traditional perimeter defenses without
  triggering early detection.
* **Identity policy and insider risk (11%):**
  Stemming from internal trust and architectural flaws, these
  vectors involve the exploitation of valid permissions. Attackers
  leverage IAM misconfigurations (3%), such as overly permissive
  policies, to escalate privileges and inherit access, while
  insider threats (8%) involve the abuse of legitimate
  credentials.

Identity and vulnerability management are not separate fights. A
leaked credential can create the same exposure as an unpatched
internet-facing system.

## The Way Through: Identity Turns Access Into Impact

After initial access, identity gaps are one of the most common ways
attackers turn a foothold into a high-impact breach. In modern
environments, authenticated actions determine speed and blast
radius.

[Unit
42](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/unit-42-cloud-threat-report-volume-6) analysis of more than 680,000 identities across cloud
accounts found that 99% of cloud users, roles and services had
excessive permissions, some unused for 60 days or more. This creates
an environment where lateral movement is easier than it should be,
because many identities carry privileges they don’t need day to day.

Attackers exploit both human and machine identities as operational
levers:

* **Privilege escalation:** Over-scoped roles,
  inherited permissions and unretired legacy grants create
  repeatable paths to higher privilege. Once an attacker can write
  to IAM, they can often escalate quickly without deploying novel
  tooling.
* **Credential reuse and lateral movement:**
  Actors commonly test compromised credentials across other
  systems. This is especially true where passwords are reused
  across production and non-production environments, or where
  shared accounts still exist.
* **Token and OAuth misuse:** Stolen session
  tokens and illicit OAuth grants let attackers bypass interactive
  authentication (including MFA), persist without repeated logins
  and operate with fewer obvious alerts.

Trust paths (e.g., shared administrative accounts, delegated access
and third-party tools) become fast lanes for lateral movement.
Without tight privilege boundaries and strong identity segmentation,
a single compromised identity can expand into broad access.

## The Expanding Identity Attack Surface

The identity landscape is expanding and fragmenting. As
organizations adopt cloud, SaaS and AI-enabled workflows, identity
moves into areas that often sit outside consistent governance,
creating areas where attackers operate with reduced visibility.

Three trends are driving this shift:

* **The rise of machine and AI identities:**
  Non-human identities, like service accounts, automation roles,
  API keys and emerging AI agents, often outnumber human users.
  These identities are frequently over-privileged, rely on
  long-lived credentials and are inconsistently monitored. For an
  attacker, compromising a service account can be higher leverage
  and quieter than compromising a person.
* **Shadow identities:** Cloud and AI adoption
  has increased the volume of unsanctioned accounts, developer
  environments and third-party connectors. These shadow identities
  often bypass standard onboarding, review and logging, creating
  access paths the SOC might not see until after impact.
* **Identity silos:** Most enterprises operate
  multiple identity systems (e.g., Active Directory, Okta,
  cloud-native IAM). When authentication and authorization are
  fragmented, so is visibility. Attackers can move between
  on-premises and cloud environments while leaving incomplete
  trails in any single control plane.

Misconfiguration at scale turns identity from a control into a
liability. When machine identities, shadow access and fragmented
identity estates combine, attackers gain more reliable paths to
persist and expand. And defenders lose end-to-end visibility.

## Countermeasures: Disrupting Identity-Driven Tradecraft

These tactical steps can disrupt the identity-related tradecraft
observed in Unit 42 cases:

* **Deploy phishing-resistant MFA:** Standard
  MFA is not enough against modern bypass and
  adversary-in-the-middle tactics. Prioritize FIDO2/WebAuthn
  hardware keys or passkeys for high-value roles (admins,
  executives, developers).
* **Inventory and rotate machine identities:**
  Establish continuous discovery for non-human identities (service
  accounts, automation roles, API keys). Immediately rotate static
  credentials for any privileged service account that has not
  changed in 90 days and reduce credential lifetime wherever
  possible.
* **Harden the session:** Attackers
  increasingly pivot post-login by stealing tokens and misusing
  OAuth grants. Reduce session lifetimes for sensitive
  applications and enforce conditional access that continuously
  evaluates device health, location and risk during the session.
* **Eliminate standing admin rights:** Move
  privileged access to a just-in-time model. Remove persistent
  admin grants and require time-bound elevation with approvals and
  strong logging, so a compromised account yields minimal
  privilege by default.

### Trend 3. Software Supply Chain Attacks Increasingly Drive Downstream Disruption

Supply chain risk is no longer limited to vulnerable code. In 2025,
the supply chain expanded to include SaaS integrations, vendor
management planes and complex dependency ecosystems. The defining
pattern was downstream disruption and parallel assessment. When an
upstream provider reported a compromise or outage, customers were
often left to stop and answer a basic question: are we affected? In
many cases, they had limited visibility into their own exposure.

The new failure mode is not one compromised customer. There are many
customers pushed into parallel triage while the upstream picture is
still unclear. This makes the supply chain a high-value target for
both nation-states and criminal groups. A single compromise can
create a one-to-many opportunity, delivered through the trusted
connectivity modern business relies on.

## SaaS Integrations: Inherited Permissions at Scale

SaaS environments are stitched together through OAuth apps, API keys
and workflow automation. These connections routinely carry access to
data and business processes. For attackers, compromised integrations
can become a lateral movement path that looks like normal
automation.

This exposure is reflected in Unit 42 investigations. Data from SaaS
applications was relevant to 23% of cases in 2025, up from 18% in
2024, 12% in 2023, and just 6% in 2022. The steady increase shows
how attackers are moving past traditional perimeters and
concentrating on the cloud-based tools where modern work now takes
place.

The risk is inherited permissions. When an organization integrates a
third-party app via OAuth, that application receives whatever rights
were originally granted, sometimes including the ability to read
sensitive data, manage users or modify records. If the upstream
provider is compromised, those same permissions can be misused
downstream.

The Hidden Integration Risk

In a recent investigation involving a compromised sales
engagement platform (Salesloft/Drift integration), attackers
leveraged valid OAuth tokens to access downstream Salesforce
environments. The activity resembled routine customer
relationship manager (CRM) automation and blended into
expected integration traffic. Post-incident review revealed
a deeper issue: the organization discovered nearly 100
additional third-party integrations connected to Salesforce,
many dormant, unmonitored or owned by former employees.

## Open Source and AI: Dependency Sprawl and Build-Time Compromise

Open source remains the foundation of modern development, but the
risk increasingly concentrates in indirect dependencies. [Unit
42 research](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-cloud-threat-report-volume-7) indicates that over 60% of vulnerabilities in
cloud-native applications reside in transitive libraries. These
libraries are the “silent” dependencies pulled in through packages
that your code relies on.

Threat actors are also injecting malicious code into upstream
packages to execute during install and build steps, compromising
pipelines before deployment. Development velocity compounds this
risk. As GenAI-assisted coding becomes mainstream, teams are
ingesting more code and more dependencies faster. This is often done
with insufficient scrutiny of provenance, maintainer trust and
downstream package behavior.

The Malicious Package

We investigated a campaign where threat actors uploaded
malicious versions of legitimate npm packages. One package,
embedded deep in a dependency tree, executed
attacker-controlled code immediately upon installation.
Because this activity occurs during build and install, it
can bypass runtime detections and establish a foothold
across multiple build environments before anyone sees an
alert.

## Vendor Tools: Weaponizing Management Channels

Vendor tools, especially remote monitoring and management (RMM) and
mobile device management (MDM) platforms, are designed for
privileged administrative action at scale. When attackers gain
access to a vendor’s management infrastructure (or the customer’s
tenant), they can push malware, run commands or change
configurations in ways that blend into routine administrative
traffic. This trend is backed by our observations in the field: We
identified that 39% of command-and-control (C2) techniques were
related to remote access tools (T1219).

Enterprises also inherit risk from opaque third-party applications
running inside critical workflows. When customers cannot inspect a
vendor’s codebase or security assumptions, latent backdoors,
hard-coded credentials or exposed interfaces can persist unnoticed.

The Legacy Application

In a multi-national investigation, a legacy third-party
billing application exposed an undocumented, unauthenticated
interface to the internet. Existing controls did not detect
it because the traffic appeared consistent with normal
application behavior. Deeper assessment revealed structural
flaws, including SQL injection points and hidden shell
functionality. These issues had persisted for years because
the customer could not inspect the underlying code.

## The Impact: From Response to Business Disruption

Supply chain incidents amplify disruption through uncertainty. When
a supplier is compromised, downstream teams operate in an
information vacuum. The result is organizations going into
“assessment mode” at scale, as teams pause changes, review
integrations, isolate dependencies and attempt to confirm the
absence of impact before normal operations resume.

Three systemic gaps drive that burden:

* **Inventory gaps:** Many organizations lack a
  unified view of SaaS connections, vendor agents and transitive
  libraries, slowing the answer to “where is this used?”
* **Permission opacity:** Effective privileges
  of integrations, agents and tooling are difficult to determine
  quickly without manual review, making the true impact unclear.
* **Telemetry gaps:** Because activity arrives
  through trusted channels (updates, API calls, administrative
  tooling), logs often look legitimate, which can delay detection
  and increase investigation time.

**Looking ahead:** This challenge will compound as organizations
adopt AI-enabled workflows and third-party agents. Supply chain risk
will increasingly include not just code integrity, but the integrity
of models, connectors and delegated actions executed on an
organization’s behalf.

## Countermeasures: Safeguarding the Software Supply Chain

Defending the supply chain requires reducing the **time needed to
assess exposure** and the **area of impact.**

* **Map SaaS ownership and scope:** Inventory
  OAuth apps and integrations (SaaS security posture management
  and discovery). Assign owners. Remove dormant integrations and
  those tied to departed users.
* **Design “break-glass” severing plans:**
  Predefine how to revoke tokens, disable connectors and isolate
  vendor agents without improvising during an upstream incident.
* **Log vendor and integration activity at audit
  depth:** Ensure you can answer what was executed, where
  and by whom. Alert on permission changes, token grants and
  anomalous admin actions.
* **Harden build ingestion:** Use software
  composition analysis (SCA) and provenance controls. Pin
  versions, restrict new repositories and require review for new
  dependencies, especially those that execute at install or build
  time.

### Trend 4. Nation-State Actors Are Adapting Tactics to Modern Environments

[Nation-state
operations](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-actor-groups-tracked-by-palo-alto-networks-unit-42/) expanded in 2025, advancing espionage,
pre-positioning and access campaigns. Across campaigns affiliated
with China, North Korea and Iran, three shifts stood out:

* Greater use of identity-driven access
* Deeper compromise of infrastructure and
  virtualization layers
* Early experiments with AI-enabled tradecraft
  aimed at stealth and persistence

China-aligned groups moved beyond user-level activity into
infrastructure and virtualization platforms. North Korean and
Iranian operators broadened their use of recruitment lures,
synthetic personas and tailored malware to establish access. We also
observed emerging AI-driven techniques, including deepfake identity
creation and automated C2 generation.

These developments reflect a shift toward access methods that are
significantly harder for defenders to detect and validate.

## China: Focused on the Edge and Virtualization

Chinese-nexus threat activity continued to prioritize long-term
access and data collection. Notable shifts in 2025 moved from
email-focused espionage to deeper exploitation of application,
infrastructure and virtualization layers.

[Phantom
Taurus](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/phantom-taurus/) exemplified this change, evolving from campaigns
centered on sensitive email collection to direct targeting of
databases and web servers for collection and exfiltration. Its
NET-STAR malware used advanced evasion techniques, posing
significant risk to organizations with exposed web infrastructure.

Similarly, we observed a year-long persistence campaign against
information technology, SaaS and business-process outsourcing
organizations (tracked by Unit 42 as activity cluster CL-STA-0242).
The group behind the campaign compromised virtualization platforms
operated by IT service providers and deployed BRICKSTORM malware,
which concealed C2 traffic inside ordinary encrypted web sessions,
making detection through network monitoring far more difficult.
[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/12/04/prc-state-sponsored-actors-use-brickstorm-malware-across-public-sector-and-information-technology)
has publicly attributed BRICKSTORM activity to China state-sponsored
actors.

These shifts illustrate a continued move away from user-level
collection toward deeper compromises of infrastructure and
virtualized environments, where long-term access is both more
durable and harder for defenders to detect.

## North Korea: Weaponized HR Part I

North Korean threat activity remained a persistent challenge for
enterprises in 2025. Multiple long-running campaigns continued
despite extensive public reporting, law-enforcement actions and
multilateral sanctions measures.

Unit 42 tracked at least two campaigns:

* [**Wagemole**](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/wagemole/):
  North Korean operatives obtained unauthorized remote employment
  with U.S. and European organizations and covertly routed income
  back to the regime. The access gained through these contractor
  and employee roles enabled both unauthorized financial payments
  and espionage. First publicly [exposed](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/)
  in 2023, Wagemole remained active in 2025, and we identified and
  evicted related activity from more than 20 enterprise
  environments.
* [**Contagious
  Interview**](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/contagious-interview/): Since at least 2022, operators have
  targeted software developers and IT personnel through fictitious
  job interviews that deliver malware via coding challenges. In
  2025 alone, we removed Contagious Interview infections from more
  than 10 enterprise networks, underscoring the risks associated
  with running unverified code on corporate systems.

## Iran: Weaponized HR Part II

Iranian threat activity remained high in 2025 as multiple groups
continued operations against strategic sectors. Of particular note
are Screening Serpens and Curious Serpens, both of which used
employment-themed lures to target aerospace and
satellite-communications providers. This activity reflects Iran’s
long-running interest in organizations that handle sensitive
technical and operational information.

Unit 42 tracked the following campaigns:

* **Screening Serpens (aka Smoke Sandstorm,
  UNC1549):** This group targeted government organizations
  in the Middle East by creating fraudulent employment portals
  that mimicked well-known aerospace and defense companies. These
  sites delivered malware packaged as job application materials,
  often signed with valid code-signing certificates to increase
  credibility. Operational security errors allowed Unit 42
  researchers to review the full infection chain, which prompted
  candidates to download an infected survey file or document
  bundle.
* **Curious Serpens (aka APT33, Peach
  Sandstorm):** Curious Serpens targeted a communications
  provider through job-recruitment lures sent by email and posted
  on career-oriented websites. The operation installed a modular
  backdoor capable of collecting intelligence and staging
  follow-on payloads. Operators relied on legitimate signed
  executables, DLL side-loading and evasion techniques, showing
  continued investment in a specialized tool set designed to
  circumvent modern security controls.

The Trusted Résumé

In one Screening Serpens investigation, an attacker
approached an employee through LinkedIn and personal email
with a tailored résumé file that installed malware and
enabled using legitimate remote-management tools. Once
inside, the operator gathered credentials, surveyed the
environment, deployed a custom backdoor and attempted to
remove activity traces, indicating an emphasis on
persistence and stealth.

Using realistic employment themes and signed binaries increases the
likelihood that victims will open malicious files. This highlights the
need for sensitive sectors to monitor recruitment-related activity and
verify any externally sourced documents or code.

## Nation-State Adoption of Artificial Intelligence

Evidence of large-scale AI adoption by nation-state actors remains
limited, but 2025 offered early signs that some groups are beginning
to integrate AI into their operations. Much of this activity is
difficult for defenders to observe, since many likely use cases
(such as malware development, infrastructure generation or analysis
of exfiltrated data) occur outside enterprise environments and
beyond conventional visibility. As capabilities advance,
understanding where nation-states are experimenting with AI is
increasingly important for anticipating future tradecraft.

Attackers appear most interested in using AI to strengthen
persistence and build more durable footholds. Nation-state operators
have shown a growing reliance on identity- and credibility-driven
entry points and deeper compromise of virtualized and application
infrastructure. These access methods are already difficult for
defenders to validate, and AI will likely make them more efficient
and harder to disrupt.

One of the clearest public examples emerged in July, when Ukrainian
authorities, in a [CERT-UA advisory](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6284730),
reported that suspected Russian malware known as LAMEHUG used an LLM
to generate C2 instructions through an API. Attributed to Fighting
Ursa (aka APT28, Fancy Bear), the activity replaced a human operator
with an automated workflow.

North Korean operators also showed signs of AI experimentation. In
Unit 42 [research](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/)
associated with the Wagemole campaign, investigators identified
suspected North Korean accounts using AI-based image manipulation
services to create deepfake personas for employment fraud schemes.
In a related Contagious Interview-style operation, attackers
fabricated an entire company and populated it across multiple social
networking platforms using AI-generated identities, repurposed
accounts and modified profiles belonging to real professionals. The
result was a convincing corporate façade designed to increase trust
and improve the success rate of recruitment-driven access
operations.

## Countermeasures: Defending Against Nation-State Adversaries

Focus defenses on the access paths, infrastructure layers and
trusted channels nation-state operators use to gain and maintain
long-term access.

* **Tighten verification across identity and
  recruitment workflows:** Strengthen checks on contractor
  onboarding and external hiring to catch synthetic personas,
  deepfakes and job-themed lures before they reach core systems.
* **Expand monitoring across virtualized and
  application infrastructure:** Baseline and log activity on
  virtualization platforms, web-facing applications and
  service-provider environments. Alert on deviations that signal
  persistence or lateral movement.
* **Harden and monitor the use of trusted tools
  and channels:** Review how signed binaries, encrypted
  traffic, remote-management tools and collaboration platforms are
  used. Flag patterns that suggest credential misuse or covert
  activity.
* **Instrument and govern AI-related activity in
  sensitive workflows:** Limit which AI services can
  interact with identities, source code or sensitive data. Log
  their use and investigate anomalous patterns that could indicate
  automated persona creation or AI-driven operations.

## 3. Inside the Intrusion

This section breaks down the behavior we observed in Unit 42
Incident Response investigations in 2025. We organize these
observations into four dimensions to show what attackers are doing
and how they are succeeding:

* **The attack surface:** This is where
  attackers strike. Intrusions rarely stay in one lane; they now
  span endpoints, cloud infrastructure and identity layers
  simultaneously.
* **The entry point:** This is how they get in.
  Phishing and vulnerabilities have tied as the leading initial
  access vectors, each at 22%. Attackers are pragmatic, they
  exploit human error and unpatched systems with equal frequency
  to force the door open.
* **The velocity:** This is how fast they move.
  While average times vary, the fastest group of attackers is
  accelerating, shrinking the window for effective defense.
* **The impacts:** This is the cost to the
  victim. This year marked a shift away from encryption and toward
  data theft and extortion.

## 3.1. The Attack Surface: Intrusions Span the Enterprise

### Attacks Rarely Stay in One Lane

Table 1 lists the primary attack surfaces involved in Unit 42
investigations in 2025, spanning endpoints, networks, cloud
services, identity systems, applications, email and user-driven
activity. These categories represent the primary operational layers
where we observed attacker activity during investigations. Because
intrusions frequently span multiple layers, they are not mutually
exclusive and do not sum to 100%. A single incident may involve
several at once.

| Attack Surface | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | 89% |
| Endpoints | 61% |
| Network | 50% |
| Human | 45% |
| Email | 27% |
| Application | 26% |
| Cloud | 20% |
| SecOps | 10% |
| Database | 1% |

***Table 1.** Attack surfaces involved in intrusions,
showing the percentage of incidents in which each surface
was affected.*

Across all incidents, 87% involved activity across two or more
attack surfaces. Sixty-seven percent of incidents involved activity
across three or more surfaces. Activity across four or more attack
surfaces appeared in 43% of attacks, and we have observed cases with
activity across as many as eight attack surfaces. While the
distribution of affected attack surfaces varies year to year, this
pattern reinforces the fact that intrusions rarely remain confined
to a single surface and often expand as access and opportunity grow.

Identity featured prominently in many incidents — at nearly 90% —
representing one of the most commonly involved attack surfaces in
our caseload.

Activity targeting humans also appeared frequently, accounting for
45% of incidents. This pattern echoes the broader themes in our
recent
[Social Engineering
Report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/2025-unit-42-global-incident-response-report-social-engineering-edition/),
which highlights how human-layer interaction continues to play a
decisive role in intrusion success.

### The Browser Attack Surface: Attacks at the Human Interface

Browser activity played a role in 48% of investigations this year
(up from 44% in 2024). This reflects how routine web sessions expose
users to malicious links, credential-harvesting pages and injected
content when local controls are weak.

In one ClickFix incident we investigated, attackers directed an
employee at a global industrial firm to a spoofed website through
search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning while searching for a
restaurant. The site used social-engineering prompts to convince the
employee to execute malicious code copied into their clipboard,
after which the attacker attempted to run malware in memory. The
attacker appeared to be trying to download an infostealer, although
we could not confirm the exact payload.

A global medical technology firm experienced an intrusion that began
with SEO poisoning. An administrator accessed a spoofed site hosting
a malicious version of an administrative tool, and the link was
later shared with a domain administrator through an internal
messaging call. This resulted in the execution of the compromised
software. After gaining a foothold, the attacker deployed ransomware
across key systems, exfiltrated data and issued a ransom demand. The
resulting disruption affected manufacturing, distribution, shipping
and order processing for an extended period while systems were
restored.

Unmanaged applications and limited browser protections allowed an
initial execution attempt in one incident before it was contained.
In another, privileged execution of a malicious administrative tool
enabled ransomware deployment and broader operational disruption.

### The Cloud Attack Surface: Compromising the Pipeline

Reflecting a continuation of last year’s pattern, about 35% of our
investigations involved cloud or SaaS assets. In these cases, the
investigation required collecting logs or images from cloud
environments or reviewing activity within externally hosted
applications, indicating that the intrusion touched cloud-hosted
assets or workflows.

Cloud weaknesses varied, but even basic issues shaped attacker
behavior once they established access. In one investigation,
sensitive cloud credentials were found exposed in a public
repository, expanding the paths attackers could use to reach cloud
environments.

In another investigation, attackers targeted a developer in an
open-source forum and persuaded them to download a poisoned
debugging tool. This turned a routine collaboration into a point of
cloud compromise.

The compromised tool provided attackers with access to the
developer’s stored cloud credentials. They used these credentials to
reach backend systems and trigger unauthorized withdrawals across
several blockchain networks. This case shows how access obtained
through cloud-native development workflows can be misused to reach
sensitive systems and cause substantial impact.

## 3.2. The Entry Point: Initial Access Comes from Predictable Paths

Initial access in 2025 followed a familiar pattern, with most
intrusions beginning through a concentrated set of well-understood
vectors. Figure 1 shows the distribution of those pathways across
the past five years, highlighting how phishing and software
vulnerabilities consistently appear among the top entry points.
While the relative balance between vectors shifts year to year, the
overall trend is stable: attackers continue to rely on a small
number of dependable techniques to gain their initial foothold.

Show all

**Figure 1.**  Initial access vectors (2021–2025). Unit 42
data collection methodology has adjusted to provide more
granularity, reducing the “Other” category. Increased
granularity also introduces new categories, such as “Insider
threat and Misuse of trusted relationships and tools.” When data
is not available for a specific year, it is denoted by N/A.

### Phishing and Vulnerabilities Tie for Dominance

Phishing and vulnerability exploitation are the most common initial
access vectors, with each accounting for **22%** of the initial
access across 2025 incidents. This parity exists simply because both
methods work incredibly well.

Phishing campaigns are achieving higher conversion rates as AI helps
attackers craft credible, error-free lures that bypass traditional
filters and engage users more effectively. At the same time,
vulnerability exploitation is accelerating as attack surfaces expand
and automation allows adversaries to scan for and exploit weaknesses
faster than defenders can patch. Because both vectors offer a
reliable path to compromise, attackers are heavily utilizing both.

Beyond phishing and vulnerability exploitation, we see important
trends for the other key initial access vectors across the five-year
dataset:

* Previously compromised credentials declined to
  13% in 2025, reversing heightened activity reported in 2023 and
  2024.
* Activity within the “Other Social Engineering”
  category grew substantially over the period, rising from 3% in
  2021 to 11% in 2025 even after we introduced more granularity.
  Much of this growth appears to align with direct-interaction
  tactics such as the help-desk manipulation techniques used by
  groups like Muddled Libra.
* Brute force fell from 13% to 8%, ending a
  multi-year rise and suggesting stronger identity controls across
  many organizations.
* IAM misconfigurations remain a persistent
  initial access vector, appearing between 1% and 4% throughout
  the five-year period.

### Vulnerability Exploitation Is Driven by Opportunity, Not Novelty

Attackers rely on vulnerability exploitation when it offers a clear
operational advantage. The five-year pattern shows actors responding
directly to the kinds of weaknesses available to them and the effort
required to turn those weaknesses into access.

When high-impact issues appear in widely deployed systems, operators
move quickly because the potential reach is substantial and the work
needed to automate exploitation is relatively low.

This pattern reflects attacker pragmatism. Operators tend to exploit
whatever is most accessible and cost-effective at any given moment.

### Big Environments, Bigger Vulnerability Exposure

The data suggests that the largest enterprises face a different
balance of initial-access risk: in 2025, vulnerabilities accounted
for just over a quarter (26%) of initial access in these
environments, compared with 17% for phishing. This pattern indicates
that larger firms may be reducing their phishing exposure through
stronger email filtering, user awareness and identity controls.
These measures do not eliminate phishing risk but likely limit its
effectiveness relative to smaller organizations.

Large, distributed environments with mixed ownership, legacy systems
and uneven patching cycles make it easier for exploitable weaknesses
to persist even in well-funded organizations. For firms of this
size, complexity itself increases the likelihood that
vulnerabilities go unaddressed, explaining why exploitation appears
more frequently as an initial access vector.

## 3.3. Velocity: The Fastest Attacks Are Getting Faster

The time-to-exfiltration, which measures the duration between
initial compromise and confirmed data theft, shows a sharp
acceleration at the fastest end of the spectrum. The quickest
quartile of intrusions reached exfiltration in just over an hour (72
minutes) in calendar year 2025, down from nearly five hours (285
minutes) in 2024, as shown in Figure 2. The share of incidents
reaching exfiltration in under one hour also increased—from 19% in
2024 to 22% in 2025.

![Time to exfiltrate comparison between 2024 and 2025](/content/dam/pan/en_US/includes/igw/ir-report-new/images/figure-2.png)

  

**Figure 2.** First-quartile attack speeds increased when
comparing calendar year 2024 with calendar year 2025.

Across the full dataset, the median time to exfiltration (MTTE) was
two days. Although longer than the fastest incidents, even the
median highlights how quickly attackers can access and remove data
once inside the environment.

Defenders must be prepared for intrusions that progress from
compromise to exfiltration in minutes or hours as well as slower,
more methodical operations that unfold over days that involve deeper
reconnaissance and durable persistence.

## 3.4. The Impact: Extortion Beyond Encryption

Encryption appeared in 78% of extortion cases in 2025, a sharp
decline from the near-or-above-90% levels for 2021–2024 shown in
Table 2. This represents the most pronounced year-over-year change
in the dataset and shows that traditional ransomware has not
disappeared, but it is no longer uniformly present in extortion
operations.

| Extortion Tactic | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Encryption | 96% | 90% | 89% | 92% | 78% |
| Data Theft | 53% | 59% | 53% | 60% | 57% |
| Harassment | 5% | 9% | 8% | 13% | 10% |

***Table 2.** How extortion tactics have changed
2021–2025.*

The reduction in encryption does not correspond to a rise in other
individual tactics. Instead, it reflects that attackers increasingly
view encryption as optional rather than essential. Several 2025
intrusions proceeded with extortion even when victims retained
access to their systems. In these cases, data exposure, direct
pressure or both were sufficient to generate leverage without
file-locking.

Data theft remained a consistent feature of extortion activity,
appearing in more than half of cases year over year. Threat actors
frequently used the threat of exposure on leak sites, and in some
instances the resale of stolen data, to pressure victims regardless
of whether encryption occurred.

Harassment, while less common, remained a persistent tactic. These
behaviors included contacting employees directly, threatening to
publish internal information or claiming they would sell customer
data to other actors if victims didn’t pay. Some groups escalated
pressure by reaching out to customers or partners, amplifying
reputational and operational strain even when systems remained
accessible.

These patterns show that extortion has decoupled from encryption.
While encryption remains prominent, attackers now have multiple
reliable ways to create leverage. This broadens the range of
conditions under which extortion can occur. It also reinforces the
need for visibility, rapid response and strong data-handling
practices regardless of whether attackers deploy ransomware.

### Data Theft Remains Durable Leverage

Ransom economics helps explain why attackers continue to pursue
these operations. Table 3 shows that median initial demands
increased from $1.25 million in 2024 to $1.5 million in 2025, and
median payments also rose.

|  | 2024 | 2025 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Median initial ransom demands | $1.25 million | $1.5 million |
| Median ransom payments | $267,500 | $500,000 |

***Table 3.** Ransomware remains a lucrative option for
attackers.*

When measured against perceived annual revenue (PAR), these demands
represented 0.55% of PAR, down from 2% the prior year. Many
ransomware groups appear to be researching victims’ ability to pay
and using this information to calibrate demands. Asking for a lower
percentage of PAR could reflect a strategy aimed at increasing the
likelihood of payment.

Among organizations that chose to pay, median payments rose from
$267,500 to $500,000, though payments as a share of PAR fell from
0.6% to 0.26%. The gap between initial demands and final payments
shows how much room victims often have to negotiate, and it
underscores the value of structured negotiation in limiting
financial exposure.

The choice to pay remains highly situational, influenced by
operational impact, regulatory considerations, legal requirements
and business continuity needs. In 2025 cases where negotiations
occurred, the median reduction between initial demand and final
payment increased from 53% to 61%. This demonstrates how frequently
experienced negotiators can reduce costs even as overall attacker
pricing trends upward.

Many ransomware groups now operate with business-like structures
including defined roles, affiliate programs and repeatable
negotiation playbooks. Some cultivate “brand reputation” through
dark web communications, portraying themselves as predictable or
professional counterparts.

This brand maintenance extends to promise-keeping: in our 2025
dataset, threat actors fulfilled their commitments (such as
providing decryption keys or allegedly deleting stolen data) in 68%
of cases where they made a promise. For defenders, these
recognizable patterns can provide leverage, though they never
eliminate the risk of engaging with criminal actors.

Recovery practices also shape extortion outcomes. About 41% of
victims were capable of restoring systems from backup without
needing to pay, which reduced the operational impact of encryption
but did not eliminate downtime. Even with recovery, many
organizations still faced system rebuilds, containment work and
other delays before returning to normal operations. Restoration is
also fragile: in 26% of extortion cases, attackers impacted backups,
adding further disruption.

When encryption is mitigated through backup restoration, or when
backups fail entirely, the threat of exposure continues to pressure
victims, ensuring data theft remains central to extortion activity.

## 4. Recommendations for Defenders

This section identifies the systemic weaknesses that enable attacks
and the practical steps required to stop them. By addressing the
root causes rather than just their symptoms, organizations can
elevate their defenses to withstand both common and emerging
threats.

## 4.1. Common Contributing Factors: Why Attacks Succeed

Attacker success is rarely about zero-day exploits. Across the
incidents we responded to in 2025, we found that **in more than 90%
of incidents, preventable gaps in coverage and inconsistently
applied controls directly contributed to the intrusion.**

These gaps determine how easily an attacker gains initial access,
how quickly they move laterally and whether defenders can detect and
respond in time. Across this year's investigations, three systemic
conditions appeared repeatedly.

### 1. Visibility Gaps: Missing Context Delays Detection

Many organizations fail to leverage the telemetry needed to observe
early-stage attacker behavior. Critical indicators of initial access
and early attacker activity often go unnoticed because the SOC has
not operationalized signals across endpoint, network, cloud and SaaS
layers. The result is missing context: defenders might see
individual events, but lack the correlation to recognize an active
intrusion.

This fragmentation forces responders to manually reconstruct attacks
from disparate tools, creating delays that attackers exploit. In 87%
of incidents, Unit 42 investigators reviewed evidence from two or
more distinct sources to establish what happened, with complex cases
drawing on as many as 10. A lack of unified visibility consistently
slowed detection, allowing adversaries to begin lateral movement
before defenders could see the full picture.

### 2. Environmental Complexity: Inconsistency Creates the Path of Least Resistance

Security baselines are rarely applied universally. Over time,
environmental drift, driven by legacy systems, technology adoption
or merger and acquisition activity, makes it difficult to enforce a
consistent standard across the enterprise.

In multiple investigations, critical controls like endpoint
protection were fully deployed in one business unit yet missing or
degraded in another. This inconsistency creates a path of least
resistance. Over 90% of data breaches were enabled by
misconfigurations or gaps in security coverage, rather than novel
exploits.

### 3. Identity: Excessive Trust Leads to Lateral Movement

Across our investigations, identity weaknesses repeatedly turned an
initial foothold into broader access. The core issue was often
excessive trust — privileges and access paths that were too
permissive or remained in place long after they were needed.

Attackers escalated privileges by misusing unretired legacy roles
and over-permissioned service accounts. Rather than breaking in,
they advanced by using valid access where the organization had left
too much trust behind.

These failures reflect identity drift. As permissions accumulate and
exceptions persist, intruders encounter fewer barriers. Nearly 90%
of incidents trace back to an identity-related element as a critical
source of the investigation or a primary attack vector.

## 4.2. Recommendations for Defenders

The recommendations that follow focus on practical steps to address
the systemic conditions described above.

### 1. Empower Security Operations to Detect and Respond Faster

With the fastest attacks now exfiltrating data in roughly an hour,
security operations must move at machine speed. This comes from
empowering the SOC with comprehensive visibility across the
enterprise, AI to identify the signal in the noise, and automation
to drive immediate response and remediation. Adopting these six
capabilities will put your SOC in the best position to succeed:

* **Ingest all relevant security data.** Attackers do not
  operate in silos, yet defenders often monitor in them. In
  2025, visibility gaps — particularly across SaaS, cloud
  identity and automation layers — were a primary driver of
  attacker success. Critical telemetry often existed but
  remained trapped in disparate systems, preventing defenders
  from correlating identity shifts with automation outputs or
  browser-stored artifacts like session tokens.

  To detect modern intrusions, organizations must ingest and
  normalize signals from identity providers, cloud platforms
  and SaaS applications into a unified view. This
  consolidation closes the weak spots attackers exploit,
  allowing defenders to identify escalation routes early.
  Whether using rule-based detection or AI, the quality of
  insight depends entirely on the completeness of the data
  feeding it.
* **Prevent, detect and prioritize threats with AI-driven
  capabilities.** High alert volumes and fragmented
  tools allow attackers to hide by spreading activity across
  systems. Without correlation, these actions appear
  unrelated, delaying escalation. AI-driven capabilities are
  essential to stitch these disparate signals into a unified
  operational view.

  Behavioral analytics help surface subtle anomalies, such as
  unusual token use or lateral movement through cloud
  automation, that rule-based detection often fails to catch.

  AI strengthens defense by correlating events across
  identity, endpoint, cloud and network layers, prioritizing
  high-fidelity incidents over background noise. This allows
  security teams to distinguish coordinated attacks from
  routine activity instantly, ensuring analysts focus their
  efforts on the threats that pose the greatest risk rather
  than chasing false positives.
* **Enable real-time threat response with automation.**
  Delays in containment often stem from unclear ownership and
  manual validation steps that cannot keep pace with attacker
  automation. Effective response requires assigning explicit
  authority for automated containment actions, such as
  revoking tokens or isolating workloads, so that execution
  can proceed without hesitation.

  By replacing ad hoc judgment with standardized, validated
  playbooks, organizations ensure that response follows an
  auditable sequence. However, to meet the pace of modern
  threats, agentic AI must be deployed as the ultimate defense
  accelerator. These autonomous systems dynamically
  investigate complex alerts, correlating data across domains
  at machine speed to gain a complete picture.

  Once validated, agents are authorized to execute dynamic,
  surgical containment actions, from isolating affected
  systems via microsegmentation to automatically revoking
  compromised credentials. This disciplined, intelligent
  approach dramatically reduces operational drift, limits
  attacker dwell time and prevents isolated compromises from
  escalating into broader incidents.
* **Transition from reactive to proactive security.** To
  shift from reactive defense, organizations must move beyond
  traditional pentesting to continuous adversarial testing.
  Point-in-time audits rarely capture the interplay of
  identity drift and cloud misconfigurations that attackers
  exploit in real-world intrusions. Defenders need to validate
  how controls perform under realistic conditions, ensuring
  telemetry pipelines and response workflows operate as
  intended.

  Proactivity extends to recovery. Resilient organizations
  verify that systems are free of residual access, such as
  compromised credentials or altered configurations, before
  restoring services. Ensuring that remediation addresses root
  causes, rather than simply restoring outdated snapshots,
  helps prevent rapid reinfection and supports long-term
  resilience.
* **Uplevel the SOC for high-performance outcomes.** During
  active incidents, inconsistent containment or unclear
  ownership creates openings for attackers to re-establish
  access. High-performance SOCs eliminate this variance by
  ensuring response actions are applied uniformly, regardless
  of the analyst or time of day.

  Consistency under pressure is critical; it prevents isolated
  compromises from escalating into broader crises.

  Achieving this requires bridging operational silos across
  Security, IT, and DevOps. Playbooks should reflect how
  systems operate today, rather than how they were originally
  designed, so that automated actions align with real business
  logic. Empowering analysts with broader responsibility, such
  as end-to-end incident response rather than alert triage
  alone, improves retention, increases versatility and drives
  measurable business outcomes.
* **Deepen your bench with an IR retainer.** The right
  retainer extends your capabilities beyond emergency
  response. To stay ahead, organizations must test and
  validate controls against the specific behaviors threat
  actors use in the wild. Recurring assessments across
  offensive security, AI security, SOC processes and cloud
  security help confirm that telemetry pipelines and response
  workflows operate as intended under realistic attack
  conditions.

  Your IR retainer partner should provide rapid access to
  specialists for proactive readiness checks, detection
  engineering and validation, ensuring that defensive
  improvements hold up over time. By pairing continuous
  testing with retained expertise, organizations improve
  resilience.

By aligning your SOC with these core principles, you transform your
defense into a high-velocity response engine capable of
outmaneuvering adversaries and stopping threats before they
escalate.

### 2. Adopt Zero Trust to Constrain the Area of Impact

Zero trust is a strategic necessity in an environment where identity
has become the primary attack surface. The goal is to eliminate
implicit trust relationships between users, devices and applications
and to continuously validate every stage of a digital interaction.

In reality, achieving zero trust is complex. However, even small
gains will reduce the attack surface, constrain lateral movement and
minimize the impact of any initial access to your environment. By
removing the assumption of safety inside the perimeter, defenders
force attackers to work harder for every inch of access, slowing
their velocity and creating more opportunities for detection.

* **Continuously verify users, devices and applications.**
  Attackers frequently exploit the static trust that persists
  after an initial login. Once inside, they use stolen session
  tokens or valid credentials to masquerade as legitimate
  users, often bypassing perimeter controls entirely. Static
  checkpoints at the front door are no longer sufficient.

  Continuous verification treats trust as dynamic, with
  decisions revisited as conditions change during a session.
  Validating identity context, device health and application
  behavior in real time allows organizations to detect when a
  legitimate session is hijacked or when user behavior
  deviates from the norm. As a result, compromised accounts or
  devices remain useful to attackers for only a limited
  period, reducing opportunities to expand access or stage
  data.
* **Enforce least privilege to constrain attacker
  movement.** Excessive permissions act as a force
  multiplier for attackers. In many 2025 incidents, intruders
  bypassed internal controls by taking advantage of identity
  drift, using accumulated privileges and unretired roles that
  organizations failed to remove. Rather than relying on
  complex exploits, they moved laterally through valid but
  over-provisioned access paths.

  Enforcing least privilege reduces this attack surface by
  limiting users, services and applications to only the access
  required for their function. This must extend beyond human
  users to include machine identities and service accounts,
  which often retain broad, poorly monitored permissions.
  Removing unnecessary rights eliminates the straightforward
  access paths attackers rely on, forcing them into more
  visible and difficult techniques that are easier for
  defenders to detect.
* **Apply consistent inspection across trusted and untrusted
  traffic.** Apply consistent inspection across trusted
  and untrusted traffic. Attackers know that while the
  perimeter is guarded, internal “east–west” traffic between
  workloads often passes without inspection. They exploit this
  trust by using encrypted internal connections to move
  laterally and stage data without triggering alarms.

  To achieve consistent, pervasive threat analysis,
  organizations must consolidate all network, cloud and secure
  access service edge (SASE) security onto a single unified
  platform. This unified fabric delivers consistent Layer 7
  inspection everywhere, automatically enforcing policy via
  one management plane.

  This consolidation enables the strategic shift to advanced
  cloud-delivered security services. This shift allows
  real-time, inline analysis of all traffic, including crucial
  decryption and inspection of traffic moving between internal
  workloads. This capability removes the spots where attackers
  hide, proactively stopping unknown phishing, zero-day
  malware and evasive C2 activity.
* **Control data access and movement to reduce impact.**
  The most damaging outcomes in many incidents occur not at
  initial compromise but during subsequent data access,
  staging and exfiltration. Attackers often search for
  repositories with weak controls or poorly monitored flows to
  quietly aggregate sensitive information before detection.

  Stronger governance over how data is accessed, shared and
  transferred reduces these opportunities by limiting where
  sensitive information can move and under what conditions.
  When data pathways are tightly controlled and consistently
  monitored, attackers face fewer options to prepare or
  extract valuable assets, reducing the scale and severity of
  potential loss even when a compromise occurs.

By systematically eliminating implicit trust, you strip attackers of
the mobility they rely on, ensuring that a single point of
compromise leads to a contained incident rather than an
enterprise-wide crisis.

### 3. Stop Identity Attacks with Stronger Identity and Access Management

Identity is now the security perimeter, yet it too often remains
poorly secured. Identity weaknesses were a determining factor in
over half of the intrusions investigated in 2025, primarily because
identity stores expanded faster than the controls intended to govern
them.

Attackers consistently moved through the gaps created by this
governance drift, exploiting legacy permissions and unmonitored
service accounts to bypass perimeter defenses. To stop this,
organizations must manage identity not as a static list of
credentials, but as a dynamic operational asset across the entire
lifecycle.

* **Centralize identity management for humans and
  machines.** You cannot govern what you cannot see.
  When identity data is fragmented across legacy directories,
  cloud providers and SaaS environments, attackers take
  advantage of the resulting weak spots.

  Centralizing user and machine identities into authoritative
  directories simplifies authentication and removes hidden
  access paths that are difficult to monitor consistently.
  This consolidation should also include third-party
  integrations and API connectors so that every entity
  requesting access, whether a person, a service account or an
  AI agent, is visible to security teams. With a unified
  control plane in place, defensive AI can correlate login
  anomalies with suspicious activity, turning identity into an
  active operational signal rather than a static list of
  credentials.
* **Combat governance drift with continuous lifecycle
  management.** Governance drift, where operational
  changes move faster than the controls designed to guide
  them, remained a significant contributor to attacker
  leverage.

  Role transitions, rapid deployment cycles and everyday
  shortcuts widened the gap between written policy and actual
  access. Permissions held by workflow tools and service
  connectors often exceeded what policy intended. This created
  escalation paths that attackers exploited through legacy
  permissions and unmonitored service accounts. Treating
  identity as a lifecycle, by limiting automation to current
  needs and retiring excess access over time, helps close
  these gaps and restrict attacker movement after initial
  access.
* **Detect and respond to identity-based threats.**
  Defensive AI performs most effectively in environments where
  identities are managed as operational assets rather than
  static credentials. In our investigations, organizations
  with strong identity foundations showed earlier linkage
  between login anomalies, automation activity and peripheral
  identity events, which contributed to faster containment.

  Where governance was strong, detection pipelines produced
  clearer and more reliable indicators that helped teams
  identify escalation behavior earlier. In contrast, weak
  governance created noise that obscured these signals.
  Regular reviews keep permissions aligned to real
  requirements, improving the accuracy of detection signals
  and ensuring that AI-assisted controls operate effectively.
* **Secure AI and automation integrity.** As organizations
  embed AI agents and automated workflows into core processes,
  these systems become attractive targets for manipulation. In
  our investigations, we observed assistant accounts deployed
  with broad default access and automation tools running
  without integrity validation.

  To prevent these tools from becoming vectors for attack,
  security teams must apply the same governance rigor to AI
  systems as they do to human users. This includes explicitly
  validating automation steps before they enter production,
  applying integrity checks to AI-enabled workflows and
  ensuring that assistant accounts are hardened against
  misuse.

By treating identity as a dynamic operational system rather than a
static directory, you eliminate the hidden pathways attackers rely
on and enable security teams to detect misuse the moment it occurs.

### 4. Secure the Application Lifecycle from Code to Cloud

Protecting the modern enterprise requires more than securing
infrastructure. It requires securing the factory that builds it.

In 2025, attackers increasingly targeted the software supply chain
and cloud APIs to bypass traditional perimeters, injecting
vulnerabilities into code or exploiting weak integrations before
they ever reached production. To counter this, organizations must
extend security safeguards from the earliest stages of development
through to runtime, treating AI models, build pipelines and
third-party code with the same rigor as internal systems.

* **Prevent security issues from reaching production.**
  Security must operate at the speed of development.
  Integrating safeguards into DevOps and continuous
  integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
  helps identify and remediate vulnerabilities in custom code,
  open-source components, and AI configurations before
  deployment.

  The same approach applies to AI systems, where early
  assessment of model security and configuration reduces
  downstream risk. Hardening development tools and governing
  open-source dependencies helps eliminate weak spots that
  attackers exploit to inherit trust within business
  workflows.
* **Secure the software and AI supply chain.** Although not
  the most common attack vector, supply chain compromises
  yield the highest impact, especially for otherwise mature
  organizations. Weaknesses in build systems, integration
  services and AI-related repositories allow attackers to
  reach downstream environments without ever interacting with
  a firewall.

  Reducing this exposure requires strict provenance checks.
  Build environments and deployment pipelines must have clear
  identity controls and integrity protections. External
  software libraries, API connectors and AI components should
  be evaluated for access patterns and update practices before
  adoption. Effective supply chain governance gives detection
  processes a reliable baseline, making it easier to identify
  when a trusted dependency begins behaving unexpectedly.
* **Identify and block runtime attacks.** Once applications
  are live, the focus shifts to containment. Attackers
  frequently attempt to persist and expand access by misusing
  legitimate cloud identities, APIs or workload permissions.

  Real-time detection, combined with consistent runtime
  controls such as behavioral monitoring, clear network
  boundaries and limits on unexpected API interactions, helps
  disrupt these tactics. The same protections should extend to
  AI hosting environments, where monitoring for model drift
  and unauthorized data access limits attacker movement even
  after initial compromise.
* **Automate cloud detection and response.** In the cloud,
  speed is the only metric that matters. Delays in isolating
  affected workloads or revoking misused identities give
  attackers the room they need to escalate.

  Automation allows SecOps teams to detect and respond to
  cloud-based threats continuously, using native cloud
  controls to contain incidents quickly. Actions such as
  isolating compromised containers or revoking suspicious
  session tokens help prevent localized issues from escalating
  into broader outages or data loss.
* **Build a culture of secure AI and development.** AI is
  now an operational asset, not just a tool. As assistants and
  automated prompts become embedded in daily workflows, they
  introduce behavioral risks that technical controls alone
  cannot solve.

  A strong security culture treats AI systems with the same
  discipline as critical infrastructure. This includes
  reviewing how assistants are used, avoiding the exposure of
  sensitive data in prompts and validating AI-generated code.
  When teams understand that human judgment remains central to
  effective AI use, governance controls are reinforced rather
  than bypassed, ensuring that the drive for automation does
  not outpace the ability to oversee it.

By embedding security into the fabric of your development and
runtime environments, you help ensure that the speed of AI and cloud
innovation drives business growth rather than systemic risk.

### 5. Secure the Attack Surface and the Human Interface

Securing the organization now requires looking beyond the corporate
laptop. The modern attack surface has expanded to include unmanaged
contractor devices, public-facing cloud assets and the web browser
itself, which has become the primary workspace for the enterprise.

As defenders, we face a dual challenge. We must rigorously manage
the external exposures that attackers constantly scan for, while
simultaneously securing the human interface where users interact
with data, AI and the open web. To protect this sprawling
environment, security must extend its reach from the external edge
down to the browser session.

* **Reduce the attack surface with active exposure
  management.** Unit 42 found that software
  vulnerabilities accounted for 22% of initial access for
  incidents this year, underscoring the urgent need to move
  beyond simple discovery to active risk prioritization.
  Effective exposure management bridges this gap by creating a
  complete, continuous inventory of the digital footprint,
  including the shadow infrastructure and unauthorized AI
  tools that traditional scans miss.

  Crucially, this strategy must filter out the noise, using
  threat intelligence to prioritize only those assets that are
  actively being targeted in the wild (such as [CISA KEVs](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog))
  and lack compensating controls. By focusing limited
  resources on exploitable, business-critical risks, teams can
  close the window of opportunity before an attacker finds an
  open door.
* **Protect the human interface.** The browser is the new
  endpoint and the new corporate desktop. This is where
  employees access data, where contractors perform their work
  and unfortunately, where social engineering attacks like
  phishing are most effective.

  Securing this interface requires an enterprise-grade secure
  browser that establishes a fully isolated and secured
  corporate workspace for both managed and unmanaged devices.
  This powerful layer enforces data controls in real-time,
  regardless of the underlying hardware. It can disable copy
  and paste on sensitive pages, prevent file downloads from
  unknown sources and identify advanced phishing sites that
  evade standard email filters. By hardening the browser,
  organizations gain granular visibility into shadow AI usage
  and directly prevent sensitive corporate data from leaking
  into unauthorized GenAI tools.
* **Secure third-party and unmanaged access.** The rigid
  model of shipping corporate laptops to every contractor or
  acquisition target is no longer sustainable or secure.
  Organizations need a way to enforce zero trust access on
  unmanaged devices without the cost and complexity of legacy
  virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions.

  By securing the workspace through the browser, companies can
  grant contractors and BYOD users secure access to corporate
  applications while keeping business data strictly isolated
  from personal environments. This approach accelerates merger
  and acquisition integration, and contractor onboarding while
  ensuring that a compromised personal device cannot be used
  as a stepping stone into the corporate network.
* **Collect unified telemetry and automate response.** For
  the endpoints you do manage, data is the fuel for defense.
  Detecting sophisticated attacks depends on collecting
  high-fidelity telemetry across processes, network
  connections and identity behavior, then unifying that data
  within a central platform.

  When this data is analyzed by AI-driven engines, anomalies
  that would be invisible in isolation become clear indicators
  of compromise. However, detection is only half the battle.

  To minimize damage, response mechanisms must be automated.
  Security teams must be empowered to isolate compromised
  endpoints, initiate forensic scans and remediate threats at
  machine speed, ensuring that a localized infection does not
  become a systemic breach.

By securing the browser as the primary workspace and rigorously
managing the external attack surface, you protect the users and
assets that traditional endpoint controls can no longer reach.

## 5. Appendix

We organized the data in this section in three dimensions, providing
defenders with a clearer view of the patterns we have observed in
2025. First, we outline the MITRE ATT&CK® techniques most
closely linked to each tactic. We then present regional and
industry-level views that show how investigation types shift across
geographies and sectors.

## 5.1 Overview of Observed MITRE Techniques by Tactic

The following series of charts (Figures 3-14) show the MITRE
ATT&CK® techniques we observed in association with
specific tactics. Note that the percentages shown represent the
prevalence of each technique when compared across the other kinds of
techniques identified for each respective tactic. These percentages
don’t represent how often the techniques showed up in cases (see the
website version to explore data about unique techniques and cases).

## 5.2 Investigation Type by Region

Figures 15-17 provide a regional and industry-level view of the
investigations handled by Unit 42 during 2025. They show how
incident types vary across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific,
alongside a breakdown of the most common investigation categories
within the industries most represented in our data. These insights
will help leaders understand where activity is concentrated and how
exposure differs across sectors and geographies.

The geographic data highlights differences in investigation types
regionally, while the industry charts show clear patterns in how
threat activity aligns with sector-specific operations and
technology stacks. High technology, manufacturing, financial
services and healthcare each exhibit distinct mixes of intrusion
types, reflecting variation in attack surface, identity architecture
and cloud maturity. Together, these views give security leaders a
clearer picture of where threats are most active and how the
operational context shapes the intrusions Unit 42 investigates.

## 6. Methodology

We sourced data for this report from more than 750 cases Unit 42
responded to between Oct. 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025, with
comparisons to metrics from earlier case data going back to 2021.
Our clients ranged from small organizations with fewer than 50
personnel to Fortune 500, Global 2000 and government organizations
with more than 100,000 employees.

The affected organizations were headquartered in over 50 countries.
About 65% of the targeted organizations in these cases were
headquartered in the U.S. Cases involving organizations based in
Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific formed the remaining 35% of
the work. Attacks frequently had an impact beyond the locations
where the organizations were headquartered.

We combined this case data with insights from our threat research,
which is informed by product telemetry, observations from dark web
leak sites and other open-source information. Incident responders
also contributed their firsthand observations of key trends based on
direct work with clients.

Several factors may influence the nature of our dataset, including a
trend toward engagements with larger organizations with more mature
security postures. We also emphasized cases that reveal emerging
trends, which for some topics means focusing on smaller segments of
the overall dataset.

For some analysis areas, we chose to filter our data to avoid skewed
results. For example, we offered incident response support to help
customers investigate potential impacts of CVEs 2024-0012 and
2024-3400, which caused these vulnerabilities to be overrepresented
in our dataset. Where appropriate, we corrected for this
overrepresentation.

Our guiding principle throughout has been to provide insights into
the present and emerging threat landscape, enabling defenders to
strengthen their posture against what attackers are doing now and
where they are headed next.
