Executive Summary

Agentic AI is the next evolution of AI, holding transformative potential for users and businesses.
Compared to generative AI, AI agents can take actions, adapt to new information, and interact with
other  agents  and  systems  to  complete  tasks  on  behalf  of  humans.  While  use  cases  are  rapidly
evolving,  agents  are  already  transforming  the  workplace  through  coding  assistants,  customer
service agents, and automating enterprise productivity workflows.

These greater capabilities also bring forth new risks. Agents’ access to sensitive data and ability
to make changes to their environment, such as updating a customer database or making a payment,
are double-edged swords. As we move towards deploying multiple agents with complex interactions,
outcomes also become more unpredictable.

Humans must remain accountable  and properly manage these risks. While existing governance
principles for trusted AI such as transparency, accountability and fairness continue to apply, they
need to be translated  in practice  for  agents. Meaningful  human control  and oversight need to  be
integrated into the agentic AI lifecycle. Nevertheless, a balance needs to be struck as continuous
human oversight over all agent workflows becomes impractical at scale.

The  Model  AI  Governance  Framework  (MGF)  for  Agentic  AI  gives  organisations  a  structured
overview of the risks of agentic AI and emerging best practices in managing these risks. If risks
are  properly  managed,  organisations  can  adopt  agentic  AI  with  greater  confidence.  The  MGF  is
targeted at organisations looking to deploy agentic AI, whether by developing AI agents in-house or
using third-party agentic solutions. Building on our previous model governance frameworks, we have
outlined key considerations for organisations in four areas when it comes to agents:

1.  Assess and bound the risks upfront

Organisations should adapt their internal structures and processes to account for new risks
from agents. Key to this is first understanding the risks posed by the agent’s actions, which
depend on factors such as the scope of actions the agent can take, the reversibility of those
actions, and the agent’s level of autonomy.

To manage these risks early, organisations could limit the scope of impact of their agents by
designing appropriate boundaries at the planning stage, such as limiting the agent’s access
to tools and external systems. They could also ensure that the agent’s actions are traceable
and controllable through establishing robust identity management and access controls for
agents.

2.  Make humans meaningfully accountable

Once the “green light” is given for agentic AI deployment, an organisation should take steps
to  ensure  human  accountability.  However,  the  autonomy  of  agents  may  complicate
traditional responsibility assignments which are tied to static workflows. Multiple actors may
also  be  involved  in  different  parts  of  the  agent  lifecycle,  diffusing  accountability.  It  is
therefore  important  to  clearly  define  the  responsibilities  of  different  stakeholders,  both

1

within the organisation and with external vendors, while emphasising adaptive governance,
so that the organisation is set up to quickly understand new developments and update its
approach as the technology evolves.

Specifically, “human-in-the-loop” has to be adapted to address automation bias, which has
become a bigger concern with increasingly capable agents. This includes defining significant
checkpoints in  the  agentic  workflow that  require human  approval,  such as high-stakes  or
irreversible actions, and regularly auditing human oversight to check that it remains effective
over time.

3.  Implement technical controls and processes

Organisations  should  ensure  the  safe  and  reliable  operationalisation  of  AI  agents  by
implementing  technical  measures  across  the  agent  lifecycle.  During  development,
organisations should incorporate technical controls for  new agentic components such as
planning,  tools  and  still-maturing  protocols,  to  address  increased  risks  from  these  new
attack surfaces.

Before  deployment,  organisations  should  test  agents  for  baseline  safety  and  reliability,
including new dimensions such as overall execution accuracy, policy adherence, and tool
use. New testing approaches will be needed to evaluate agents.

During and after deployment, as agents interact dynamically with their environment and not
all risks can be anticipated upfront, it is recommended to gradually roll out agents alongside
continuous monitoring after deployment.

4.  Enable end-user responsibility

Trustworthy deployment of agents does not rely solely on developers, but also on end-users
using them responsibly. To enable responsible use, as a baseline, users should be informed
of  the  agent’s  range  of  actions,  access  to  data,  and  the  user’s  own  responsibilities.
Organisations should consider layering on training to equip employees with the knowledge
required  to  manage  human-agent  interactions  and  exercise  effective  oversight,  while
maintaining their tradecraft and foundational skills.

This is a living document. We have worked with government agencies and leading companies to
collate current best practices, but this is a fast-developing space, and best practices will evolve. This
framework will need to be continuously updated to keep pace with new developments. We invite
feedback  to  refine  the  framework,  and  case  studies  demonstrating  how  the  framework  can  be
applied for responsible agentic deployment.

1  Introduction to Agentic AI

1.1  What is Agentic AI?

Agentic  AI  systems  are  systems  that  can  plan  across  multiple  steps  to  achieve  specified
objectives, using AI agents.1 There is no consensus on what defines an agent, but there are certain
common features – agents usually possess some degree of independent planning and action taking
(e.g. searching the web or creating files) over multiple steps to achieve a user-defined goal.2

In  this  framework,  we  focus  on  agents  built  on  language  models,  which  are  increasingly  being
adopted. Such agents use a small, large, or multimodal large language model (SLM, LLM, or MLLM)
as its brain to make decisions and complete tasks. However, it is worth noting that software agents
are not a new concept and other types of agents exist, such as those which use deterministic rules,
or other neural networks, to make decisions.3

Core components of a simple agent4

As agents are built on top of language models, it is helpful to start with the core components of
a simple LLM-based app.

1.  Model: an SLM, LLM or MLLM that serves as the central reasoning and planning engine, or
the  “brain”  of  the  agent.  It  processes  instructions,  interprets  user  inputs,  and  generates
contextually appropriate responses.

2.  Instructions:  Natural  language  commands  that  define  an  agent's  role,  capabilities,  and

behavioural constraints e.g. a system prompt for an LLM.

3.  Memory: Information that is stored and accessible to the LLM, either in short or long-term
storage.  Sometimes  added  to  allow  the  model  to  obtain  information  from  previous  user
interactions or external knowledge sources.

An agent uses the model, instructions and  memory in similar ways as an LLM-based app. In
addition, it has other components that enable it to complete more complex tasks:

4.  Planning and reasoning: The model is usually trained to reason and plan, meaning that it

can output a series of steps needed for a task.

5.  Tools: Tools enable the agent to take actions and interact with other systems, such as writing
to files and databases, controlling devices, or performing transactions. The model calls tools
to complete a task.

6.  Protocols: This is a standardised way for agents to communicate with tools and other agents.
For  example,  the  Model  Context  Protocol  (MCP)  has  been  developed  for  agents  to
communicate  with tools,5 whereas the Agent2Agent Protocol  (A2A)  defines a  standard for
agents to communicate with each other.6

1.1.2  Multi-agent setups

In an agentic system, it is common for multiple agents to be set up to work together. This can
sometimes improve performance, by allowing each agent to specialise in a certain function or task
and work in parallel. 7

Three common design patterns for multi-agent systems are:8

•  Sequential:  Agents  work  one  after  another  in  a  linear  workflow.  Each  agent’s  output

becomes the next agent’s input.

•  Supervisor: One supervising agent coordinates specialised agents under it.
•  Swarm: Agents work at the same time, handing off to another agent when needed

1.1.3  How agent design affects the limits and capabilities of each agent

While  each agent  may  have  the  same  core components, the design  of  each  component can
significantly  affect  what  the  agent  can  do.  It  is  generally  helpful  to  distinguish  between  two
concepts when considering what an agent can do:9

•  Action-space  (or  authority,  capabilities): Range  of  actions the agent  is permitted  to  take,

determined by the tools it is allowed to use, transactions it can execute, etc.

•  Autonomy (or decision-making): Degree to which an agent can decide when and how to act
towards  a  goal,  such  as  by  defining  the  steps  to  be  taken  in  a  workflow.  This  can  be
determined by its instructions and level of human involvement.

Action-space

An agent’s action-space mainly depends on the tools it has access to, which can affect:

•  Systems it can access:

o  Sandboxes only: Sandboxed tools (e.g. for code execution, data analysis) that cannot

o

affect any other system
Internal systems: Tools internal to the organisation, such as being able to search and
update the organisation’s databases

o  External systems: Tools that enable the agent to access external services, such as

retrieving and updating data through third-party pre-defined APIs.

•  Actions it can take in relation to the system it can access:

o  Read  vs  write:  An  agent  may  only  be  able  to  read  and  retrieve  information  from  a

system, rather than write to and modify data within the system.

An  emerging  modality  of  agentic  AI  is  a  computer  use  agent,  whose  primary  tool  is  access  to  a
computer and browser. This means that it can take any action that a human can take with a computer
and browser without having to rely on specifically defined tools and APIs. This significantly increases
what the agent can access and do.

Autonomy

An agent’s autonomy mainly depends on its instructions  component and the level of human
involvement in the agentic system.

In terms of instructions, an agent can be given differing level of instructions:

•  Detailed instructions and SOP: An agent instructed to follow a detailed SOP to complete a

task would be limited in the decisions it can make at each stage.

•  Using its own judgment: An agent instructed to use its own judgment to complete a task

would have more freedom to define its plan and workflow.

Another relevant factor is the level of human involvement. When interacting with an agent, a human
can be involved to different levels:10

•  Agent proposes, human operates: The human directs and approves every step taken by an

agent.

•  Agent  and  human  collaborate:  The  human  and  agent  work  together.  The  agent  requires
human  approval  at  significant  steps,  such  as  before  writing  to  a  database  or  making  a
payment.  However,  the  human  can  intervene  anytime  by  taking  over  the  agent’s  work  or
pausing the agent and requesting a change.

10

See Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, Levels of Autonomy for AI Agents.

•  Agent operates, human approves: The agent requires human approval only at critical steps
or failures, such as deleting a database or making a payment above a predefined amount.
•  Agent  operates,  human  observes:  The  agent  does  not  require  human  approval  as  it

completes its task, though its actions may be audited after the fact.

1.2  Risks of Agentic AI

1.2.1  Sources of risk

The new components of an agent constitute new sources of risks.11 The risks themselves are
familiar  –  fundamentally,  agents  are  software  systems  built  on  LLMs.  They  inherit  traditional
software vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection) and LLM-specific risks (such as hallucination, bias,
data leakage and adversarial prompt injections).12

However, the risks can manifest differently through the different components. For example:

•  Planning and reasoning: An agent can hallucinate and make a wrong plan to complete a

task.

•  Tools: An agent can hallucinate by calling non-existent tools or calling tools with the wrong
input, or calling tools in a biased manner. As tools connect the agent to external systems,
prompt  or  code  injections  can  also  manipulate  the  agent  to  exfiltrate  or  otherwise
manipulate the data it has access to.

•  Protocols: Finally, as new protocols emerge to handle agent communication, they can also
be  poorly deployed  or  compromised e.g. an  untrusted MCP  server  deployed  with  code  to
exfiltrate the user’s data.

As components within an agent or multiple agents interact, risks can also arise at the system
level.13 For example:

•  Cascading effect: A mistake by one agent can quickly escalate as its outputs are passed
onto other agents. For example, in supply chain management, a hallucinated inventory figure
from  one  agent  could  potentially  cause  downstream  agents  to  reorder  excessive  or
insufficient stock.

•  Unpredictable  outcomes:  Agents  working  together  can  also  compete  or  coordinate  in
unintended  ways.  For  example,  in  manufacturing,  different  agents  may  be  involved  in
managing machines and inventory. While coordinating to meet production goals, the agents
might  interact  unpredictably  due  to  complex  optimisation  algorithms  and  over  or  under-
prioritise one resource or machine, leading to unexpected bottlenecks.

BCG highlighted examples of new risks from agents e.g. agents that optimize their own goals locally
may create instability across the system, flawed behaviour by one agent may spread to other agents
(see What Happens When AI Stops Asking Permission?)
Adapted from CSA, Draft Addendum on Securing Agentic AI.
See WEF, AI Agents in Action: Foundations for Evaluation and Governance, which highlighted a new
class  of  failure  modes,  linked  to  potentially  misaligned  interactions  in  multi-agent  systems  e.g.
orchestration drift, semantic misalignment, interconnectedness and cascading effects.

1.2.2  Types of risk

Erroneous actions

Unauthorised
actions

Biased or unfair
actions

Data breaches

Disruption to
connected
systems

Because agents take actions in the real world, when they malfunction, it can lead to harmful
real-world impact. Organisations should be aware of these negative outcomes:

•  Erroneous  actions: Incorrect  actions such as  an agent fixing  appointments on the wrong
date  or  producing  flawed  code.  The  exact  harmful  outcome  depends  on  the  action  in
question, e.g. flawed code can lead to exploited security vulnerabilities, and wrong medical
appointments may affect a patient’s health outcomes.

•  Unauthorised actions: Actions taken by the agent outside its permitted scope or authority,
such as taking an action without escalating it for human approval based on a company policy
or standard operating procedure.

•  Biased or unfair actions: Actions that lead to unfair outcomes, especially when dealing with
groups  of  different  profiles  and  demographics,  such  as  biased  vendor  selection  in
procurement, disbursements of grants, and/or hiring decisions.

•  Data breaches: Actions that lead to the exposure or manipulation of sensitive data. Such
data  may  be  personally  identifiable  information  or  confidential  information  e.g.  customer
details, trade secrets, and/or internal communications. This can be due to a security breach,
where attackers exploit agents to reveal private information, or an agent disclosing sensitive
data due to a failure to recognise it as sensitive.

•  Disruption to connected systems: As agents interact with other systems, they can cause
disruption to connected systems when they are compromised or malfunction e.g. deleting a
production codebase, or overwhelming external systems with requests.

2  Model AI Governance Framework for Agentic AI

1. Assess and bound
the risks upfront

2. Make humans
meaningfully accountable

3. Implement technical
controls and processes

4. Enable end-user
responsibility

Four dimensions of the MGF for Agentic AI

The  MGF  for  Agentic  AI  builds  on  the  responsible  AI  practices  for  organisations  set  out  in  MGF
(2020)14 by highlighting emerging best practices to address new concerns from agentic AI. This is so
that organisations can develop and use agentic AI with the requisite knowledge and judgment.

The  framework  begins  with  helping  organisations  to  assess  and  bound  the  risks  upfront.  It
highlights new risks that should be considered during risk assessment, and design considerations at
the planning stage to limit the potential scope of impact of the agents, as well as ensure that agents
are traceable and controllable.

While agents may act autonomously, human responsibility continues to apply. Once the “green light”
is  given  to  deploy  agentic  AI,  an  organisation  should  take  immediate  steps  to  make  humans
meaningfully  accountable.  This  includes  clearly  defining  responsibility  across  multiple  actors
within and outside the organisation involved in the agent lifecycle; and taking measures to ensure
that human-in-the-loop remains effective over time notwithstanding automation bias.

To  ensure safe and reliable  operationalisation of agents, an organisation should adopt  technical
controls  and  processes  across  the  AI  lifecycle.  During  development,  guardrails  for  new
components in AI agents such as planning and tools should be implemented. Before deployment,
agents  should  be  tested  for  baseline  safety  and  reliability.  After  deployment,  agents  should  be
continuously monitored as they interact dynamically with their environment.

Finally, trustworthy deployment of agents does not rest solely on developers, but also on end-users.
Organisations  are  responsible  for  enabling  end-user  responsibility  by  equipping  them  with
essential information to use agents appropriately and exercise effective oversight, while maintaining
their tradecraft and foundational skills.

2.1  Assess and bound the risks upfront

Agents  bring  new  risks,  especially  in  their  access  to  sensitive  data  and  ability  to  change  their
environment  through  action-taking.  Their  adaptive,  autonomous  and  multi-step  nature  also
increases  the  potential  for  unexpected  actions,  emergent  risks  and  cascading
impacts.
Organisations should consider these new dimensions as part of risk assessment, and limit the scope
of impact of their agents by designing appropriate boundaries at an early stage.

When planning for the use of agentic AI, organisations should consider:

•  Determining  suitable  use  cases  for  agent  deployment  by  considering  agent-specific

factors that can affect the likelihood and impact of the risk.

•  Design choices to bound the risks upfront by applying limits on agent’s access to tools and

systems and defining a robust identity and permissions framework.

2.1.1  Determine suitable use cases for agent deployment

Risk identification and assessment is the first step when considering if an agentic use case is
suitable  for  development  or  deployment. Risk  is  a  function  of  likelihood  (probability  of  the  risk
manifesting) and impact (severity of impact if the risk manifests).

The following non-exhaustive factors affect the level of risk of an agentic use case:

Factors affecting impact

deployed

information or confidential data

external systems

Scope of agent’s
actions

transactions which require a high
degree of accuracy, vs agent that

Agent that requires access to
personal customer data gives rise to
the risk of leaking such data, vs
agent who only has access to

Agent that sends data to third-party
APIs can leak data to these third
parties, or disrupt these systems by
making too many requests, vs agent
that only has access to sandboxed
or internal tools
Read vs write: Agent that can only
read from a database vs being able
to write to it
Many tools vs a few: Agent that can
only choose from a few pre-defined
tools, vs an agent who has unlimited
access to a browser tool

modifications are easily reversed

Task complexity

Agent’s access to
external systems

A higher level of autonomy can
result in higher unpredictability,
increasing likelihood of error.
How complex the task is, in relation
to the number of steps required to
complete it and the level of analysis
required at each step.

A higher level of complexity similarly
increases unpredictability and the
likelihood of error.
Whether the agent is exposed to
external systems, and who
maintains these systems.

A higher level of exposure makes the
agent more vulnerable to prompt
injections and cyberattacks.

Illustration
Agent is provided with a SOP and
instructed to follow it when carrying
out a task, vs agent is instructed to
use its best judgment to select and
execute every step

Agent is required to extract key
action points from a meeting
transcript, vs agent is tasked to
follow a nuanced data sharing policy
when handling external requests for
information

Agent can only access an internal
knowledge base which is
maintained by trusted internal
teams, vs an agent who can access
the web containing untrusted data

Threat modelling also makes risk assessment more
rigorous by systematically identifying specific ways
in  which  an  attacker  may  take  to  compromise  the
system. Common security threats to agentic systems
include memory poisoning, tool misuse, and privilege
compromise.15 As  agentic  systems  (especially  multi-
agent systems)  can become  very complex, it is often
useful to use a method called taint tracing to map out
all  the  workflows  and  interactions  to  track  how
untrusted data can move through the system. For more
information  on  how  to  perform  threat  modelling  and
taint  tracing  for  agentic  systems,  organisations  may
refer to CSA’s Draft Addendum on Securing Agentic AI.

The  relationship  between  threat  modelling
and risk assessment

Threat modelling augments the risk assessment
process  by  generating  contextualised  threat
events with well-described sequence of actions,
activities  and  scenarios  that  the  attacker  may
take  to  compromise  the  system.  With  more
relevant threat events, risk assessments will be
more  rigorous  and  robust,  resulting  in  more
targeted controls and effective layered defence.
Since risk assessment is continuous, the threat
model should be regularly updated.

Modelling

2.1.2  Bound risks through design by defining agents limits and permissions

Having selected an appropriate agent use case, organisations can further bound the risks by
defining appropriate limits and permission policies for each agent.

Agent limits

Organisations should consider defining limits on:

•  Agent’s access to tools and systems: Define policies that give agents only the minimum
tools and data access needed for it to complete its task.16 For example, a coding assistant
may not require access to a web search tool, especially if it already has curated access to
the latest software documentation.

•  Agent’s  autonomy:  For  process-driven  tasks,  SOPs  and  protocols  are  frequently  used  to
improve  consistency  and  reduce  unpredictability. 17  Define  similar  SOPs  for  agentic
workflows that an agent is constrained to follow, rather than giving the agent the freedom to
define every step of the workflow.

•  Agent’s area of impact: Design mechanisms and procedures to take agents offline and limit
their potential scope of impact when they malfunction. This can include running agents in
self-contained environments with limited network and data access, particularly when they
are carrying out high-risk tasks such as code execution.18

Agent identity

Identity management and access control is one of the key means in which organisations enable
traceability and accountability today for humans. As agents become more autonomous, identity
management has to be extended to agents as well to track individual agent behaviour and establish
who holds accountability for each agent.

This is an evolving space, and gaps exist today in terms of handling agent identity robustly. For
example,  current  authorisation  systems  typically  have  pre-defined,  static  scopes.  However,  to
operate safely in more complex scenarios, agents require fine-grained permissions that may change
dynamically  depending  on  the  context,  risk  levels,  and  task  objectives.  Current  authentication
systems  are  also  typically  based  on  a  single,  unique  individual.  Such  systems  face  difficulty  in
handling complex agent setups, such as when agents act for multiple human users with different
permissions, or recursive delegation scenarios where agents spin up multiple sub-agents.19

See PwC, The rise – and risks – of agentic AI.
Grab  introduced  an  LLM  agent  framework  leveraging  on  Standard  Operating  Procedures  (SOPs)  to
guide AI-driven execution (see Introducing the SOP-driven LLM agent frameworks).

For  a  more  comprehensive  treatment  of  how  current  identity  systems  may  face  challenges  when
catering to agentic AI, see OpenID, Identity Management for Agentic AI.

11

Solutions  are  being  developed  to  address  these  issues,  such  as  integrating  well-established
standards like OAuth 2.0 into MCP.20 The industry is also developing new standards and solutions for
agents, such as decentralised identity management and dynamic access control.21

In the interim, organisations should consider these best practices to enable agent control and
traceability:

•

Identification: An agent should have its own unique identity, such that it can identify itself to
the organisation, its human user, or other agents. However, an agent’s identity may need to
be  tied  to  a  supervising  agent,  a  human  user,  or  an  organisational  department  for
accountability and tracking. Additionally, the different capacities in which an agent acts (e.g.
independently or on behalf of a specified human user) should also be recorded.

•  Authorisation: An agent can have pre-defined permissions based on its role or the task at
hand,  or  its  permissions  may  be  dynamically  set  by  its  authorising  human  user,  or  a
combination  of  both.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  the  human  user  should  not  be  able  to  set
permissions for the agent greater than what the human user is himself authorised to do. Such
delegations of authority should be clearly recorded.

Evaluating the residual risks

Residual risk is the risk that remains after mitigation measures have been applied. It is important to note
that there will always be a level of risk remaining, even after efforts are taken to identify appropriate agentic
use cases and define limits on any agents, especially given how quickly agentic AI is evolving. Ultimately,
organisations  should  evaluate  and  determine  if  the  residual  risk  for  their  agentic  deployment  is  of  a
tolerable level and can be accepted.

2.2  Make humans meaningfully accountable

The organisations that deploy agents and the humans who oversee them remain accountable for the
agents’  behaviours  and  actions.  But  it  can be  challenging to  fulfil  this  accountability  when  agent
actions  emerge  dynamically  and  adaptively  from  interactions  instead  of  fixed  logic.  Multiple
stakeholders may also be involved in different parts of the agent lifecycle, diffusing accountability.
Finally, automation bias, or the tendency to over-trust an automated system, especially when it has
performed reliably in the past, becomes a bigger concern as humans supervise increasingly capable
agents.

To address these challenges to human accountability, organisations should consider:

•  Clear allocation of responsibilities within and outside the organisation, by establishing
chains  of  accountability  across  the  agent  value  chain  and  lifecycle,  while  emphasising
adaptive  governance,  so  that  the  organisation  is  set  up  to  quickly  understand  new
developments and update their approach as the technology evolves.

•  Measures  to  enable  meaningful  human  oversight  of  agents,  such  as  requiring  human
approval  at  significant  checkpoints,  auditing  the  effectiveness  of  human  approvals,  and
complementing these measures with automated monitoring.

2.2.1  Clear allocation of responsibilities within and outside the organisation

As deployers, organisations and humans remain accountable for the decisions and actions of
agents. However, as with AI, the value chain for agentic AI involves multiple actors. Organisations
should  consider  the allocation  of responsibility both  within their  organisation, and vis-à-vis other
organisations along the value chain.

Within the organisation

Within  the  organisation,  organisations  should  allocate  responsibilities  for  different  teams
across the agent lifecycle. While each organisation is structured differently, this is an illustration
of how such responsibilities may be allocated across different teams:

Who: Leaders who define strategic decisions and high-level policies
for  the  organisation  e.g.  board  members,  C-suite  executives,
managing directors, or department leaders.

Key responsibilities can include:

•  Setting high-level goals for use of agents
•  Defining  permitted  operational  use  cases  for  agents,

including limits on agent’s data access

•  Setting  the  overall  governance  approach,  including  risk

management frameworks and escalation processes

Who: These roles oversee the translation of stakeholder needs or
business  goals  into  a  technical  agentic  solution  e.g.  Product
Managers, UI / UX Designers, AI Engineers, Software Engineers

Key responsibilities can include:

•  Defining the design and requirements for agents, as well as

any feature controls or phased rollouts

•  Reliable  implementation  of  agents  i.e.  development,  pre-
testing  and  post-deployment  monitoring

deployment
across the agent lifecycle

•  Educating users on responsible use of agentic product

Who:  These roles oversee the protection of agentic systems from
cyber  threats,  by implementing  and managing security measures,
identifying  vulnerabilities,  and  responding  to  incidents  e.g.  Chief
Security Officer, Cyber Security Specialist, Penetration Tester

Key responsibilities can include:

•  Defining baseline security guardrails and secure-by-design
templates that technical teams should implement or adapt
to the agentic system being deployed

•  Conducting regular red teaming and threat modelling

Key decision
makers

Product teams

Cybersecurity
teams

14

Who: Any individual who utilises the output of the agents to contribute to
an  organisational  goal  e.g.  company  employees  making  decisions  or
automating workflows and practices.

Users

Key responsibilities can include:

•  Ethical and responsible usage of agents
•  Attending  required  training,  complying  with  usage  policies,

timely reporting of bugs or issues with agents

Developing internal capabilities for adaptive governance

All  teams  involved  in  the  agentic  AI  lifecycle  should  also  develop  internal  capabilities  to
understand agentic AI. As the technology is quickly evolving, being aware of the improvements
and limitations of new agentic developments, such as new modalities like computer use agents,
or new evaluation frameworks for agents, allow organisations to quickly adapt their governance
approach to new developments.

Outside the organisation

Organisations may also need to work with external parties when deploying agents e.g. model
developers, agentic AI providers, or hosts of external MCP servers or tools.

In these cases, organisations should similarly ensure that there are measures in place to fulfil its
own accountability. Some agent-specific considerations are:

•  Clarify  distribution  of  obligations  in  any  terms  and  conditions  or  contracts between the
organisation and the external party. In particular, organisations should consider provisions
to  address  any  security  arrangements,  performance  guarantees,  or  data  protection  and
confidentiality.  Where  there  are  gaps,  the  organisation  should  reassess  if  the  agentic
deployment meets its risk tolerance.

•  Features to maintain security and control. Organisations should consider if the external
party’s product offers features for the organisation to maintain a sufficient level of security
or control. This includes strong authentication measures such as scoped API keys, per-agent
identity tokens, and robust observability such as the logging of tool calls and access history.
Where  such  features  are  lacking,  organisations  should  consider  alternative  or  in-house
solutions, or scoping down the agentic use case, such as restricting access to sensitive data.

End users

Organisations  may  deploy  agents  to  users  within  or  outside  their  organisation.  In  doing  so,
organisations should ensure that users are provided sufficient information to hold the organisation
accountable, as well as any information relating to the user’s own responsibilities. More information
can be found in Enabling end-user responsibility below.

15

2.2.2  Design for meaningful human oversight

Define significant
checkpoints or action
boundaries that require
human approval

Train humans to evaluate
these requests for approval
effectively, and audit these
approvals

Complement this with
automated monitoring
mechanisms and
predefined alert thresholds

Setting up a system for effective human supervision

Organisations should define significant checkpoints or action boundaries that require human
approval, especially before sensitive actions are executed. This can include:23

•  High-stakes actions and decisions e.g. editing of sensitive data, final decisions in high-risk

•

domains (such as healthcare or legal), actions that may trigger liability
Irreversible  actions  e.g.  permanently  deleting  data,  sending  communications,  making
payments

•  Outlier or atypical behaviour e.g. when agent accesses a system or database outside of its
work scope, when agent selects a delivery route that is twice as long as the median distance
•  User-defined. Agents may act on behalf of users who have different risk appetites. Beyond
organisation-defined  boundaries,  users  may  be  given  the  option  to  define  their  own
boundaries e.g. requiring approval for purchases above a certain amount

Apart from considering when approvals are required, organisations should also consider what
form approvals should take. These considerations include:

•  Keep  approval  requests  contextual  and  digestible.  When  asking  humans  for  approval,
keep  the  request  short  and  clear,  instead  of  providing  long  logs  or  raw  data  that  may  be
challenging to decipher and understand.

•  Consider the form of human input required. For straightforward actions such as accessing
a database, the human user can simply approve or reject. For more complex cases, such as
reviewing an agent’s plan before execution, it may be more productive for the human to edit
the plan before giving the agent the go-ahead.

Organisations  should  implement  measures  to  ensure  continued  effectiveness  of  human
oversight, particularly as humans remain susceptible to alert fatigue and automation bias. These
measures can include:

23

For  further  examples  of  where  human  involvement  may  be  considered,  see  Partnership  on  AI,
Prioritising real-time failure detection in AI agents).

16

•  Training  humans  to  identify  common  failure  modes  e.g.  inconsistent  agent  reasoning,

agents referring to outdated policies

•  Regularly auditing the effectiveness of human oversight

Finally,  human  oversight  should  be  complemented  with  automated  real-time  monitoring  to
escalate any unexpected or anomalous behaviour. This can be done by implementing alerts for
certain logged events (e.g. attempted unauthorised access or multiple failed attempts to call a tool),
using data science techniques to identify anomalous agent trajectories, or using agents to monitor
other agents. For more information, see Continuous testing and monitoring below.

17

2.3  Implement technical controls and processes

The agentic components that differentiate agents from simple LLM-based applications necessitate
additional controls during the key stages of the implementation lifecycle.

Organisations should consider:

•  During  design  and  development,  design  and  implement  technical  controls.  The  new
components  and  capabilities  of  agents  also  necessitate  new  and  tailored  controls.
Depending  on  the  agent  design,  implement  controls  such  as  tool  guardrails  and  plan
reflections. Further, limit the agent’s impact on the external environment by enforcing least-
privilege access to tools and data.

•  Pre-deployment, test agents for safety and security. As with all software, testing before
deployment ensures that the system behaves as expected. Specifically for agents, test for
new dimensions such as overall task execution, policy adherence and tool use accuracy,
and test at different levels and across varied datasets to capture the full spectrum of agent
behaviour.

•  When deploying, gradually roll out agents and continuously monitor them in production.
The  autonomous  nature  of  agents  and  the  changing  environment  makes  it  challenging  to
account for and test all possible outcomes before deployment. Hence it is recommended to
roll  out  agents  gradually,  supported  with real-time monitoring  post-deployment to  ensure
that agents function safely.

2.3.1  During design and development, use technical controls

Organisations  should  design  and  implement  technical  controls  in  the  agentic  AI  system  to
mitigate identified risks. For agents specifically, in addition to baseline software and LLM controls,
consider adding controls for:

•  New agentic components, such as planning and reasoning and tools
•

Increased security concerns from the larger attack surface and new protocols

For  illustration,  these  are  some  sample  controls  for  agents.  For  a  more  comprehensive  list,
organisations can refer to CSA’s Draft Addendum on Securing Agentic AI and GovTech’s Agentic Risk
and Capability Framework.

Planning

•  Prompt agent to reflect on whether its plan adheres to user instructions
•  Prompt  the  agent  to  summarise  its  understanding  and  request  clarification

Tools

from the user before proceeding

•  Log the agent’s plan and reasoning for the user to evaluate and verify
•  Configure tools to require strict input formats
•  Apply  the  principle  of  least  privilege  to  limit  tools  available  to  each  agent,

enforced through robust authentication and authorisation

•  For data-related tools:

o  Do not grant agent write access to tables in sensitive databases unless

strictly required

18

o  Configure agent to let user take over control when keying in sensitive

data (e.g. passwords, API keys)

Protocols

•  Use  standardised  protocols  where  applicable  (e.g.  agentic  commerce

protocols when agent is handling a financial transaction)

•  For MCP servers:

o  Whitelist trusted servers and only allow agent to interact with servers

on that whitelist

o  Sandbox any code execution

2.3.2  Before deploying, test agents

Organisations  should  test  agents  for  safety  and  security  before  deployment.  This  provides
confidence that the agents work as expected and controls are effective. Best practices on software
and LLM testing are still relevant, such as unit and integration testing for software systems, as well
as  selecting  representative  datasets,  and  useful  metrics  and  evaluators  for  LLM  testing.
Organisations can refer to previous guidance, such as the Starter Kit for testing of LLM-based apps
for safety and reliability.

However, organisations should adapt their testing approaches for agents. Some considerations
include:

•  Testing  for  new  risks:  Beyond  producing  incorrect  outputs,  agents  can  take  unsafe  or

unintended actions through tools. Organisations can consider testing for:24

o  Overall task execution: Whether agent can complete task accurately
o  Policy compliance: Whether an agent follows defined SOPs and routes for human

approval when required

o  Tool calling: Whether an agent calls the right tools, with the right permissions, with

the right inputs and in the right order

o  Robustness: As agents are expected to react and adapt to real-world situations, test

for their response to errors and edge cases

•  Testing entire agent workflows: Agents can take multiple steps in sequence without human
involvement. Thus, beyond testing an agent’s final output, agents should be tested across
their entire workflow, including reasoning and tool calling.

•  Testing  agents  individually  and  together:  Beyond  individual  agents,  testing  should  be
carried out at the multi-agent system level, to understand any emergent risks and behaviours
when  agents  collaborate,  such  as  competitive  behaviours  or  the  impact  on  other  agents
when one agent has been compromised.

•  Testing in real or realistic environments: As agents may be expected to navigate real-world
situations, testing should occur in a properly configured execution environment that mirrors
production  as  closely  as  possible,  such  as  using  tool  integrations,  external  APIs,  and
sandboxes  that  behave  as  they  would  in  deployment.  However,  organisations  should

24

19

calibrate the need for realism against the risk of prematurely allowing agents to access tools
that affect the real world.

•  Testing repeatedly and across varied datasets: Agent behaviour is inherently stochastic
and context-dependent. Testing should thus be done at scale and across varied datasets to
observe any unexpected low-probability behaviours, especially if they are high-impact. This
requires generating test datasets that cover different conditions that agents may encounter
and running these tests multiple times, including minor perturbations where needed.

•  Evaluating  test  results  at  scale:  Reliably  evaluating  test  results  at  scale  is  a  known
challenge for LLM testing. Agents add a further layer of complexity as their workflows can be
long and contain unstructured information that cannot be easily processed by humans or
automated  scripts.  Organisations  may  consider  using  different  evaluation  methods  for
different parts of the agentic workflow (e.g. deterministic tests for structured tool calls vs
LLM or human evaluation for unstructured agent reasoning). However, there is still a need to
evaluate agents holistically, so that agent patterns across steps can be evaluated. Current
industry solutions thus include defining LLMs or agents to evaluate other agents.25

2.3.3  When deploying, continuously monitor and test

As agents are adaptive and autonomous, organisations should consider mechanisms to respond to
unexpected or emergent risks when deploying agents.

Gradual deployment of agents

Organisations  should  consider  gradually  rolling  out  agents  into  production  to  control  the
amount of risk exposure. Such rollouts can be controlled based on:

•  Users of agents e.g. rolling out to trained or experienced users first
•  Tools  and  protocols  available  to  agent  e.g.  restricting  agents  to  more  secure,  whitelisted

MCP servers first

•  Systems exposed to agent e.g. using agents in lower-risk internal systems first

Continuous testing and monitoring

Organisations  should  continuously  monitor  and  log  agent  behaviour  post-deployment,  and
establish reporting and failsafe mechanisms for agent failures or unexpected behaviours. This
allows the organisation to:

•

Intervene  in  real-time:  When  potential  failures  are  detected,  stop  agent  workflow  and
escalate to a human supervisor e.g. if agent attempts unauthorised access

•  Debug  when  incidents happen:  Logging  and tracing  each step  of  an  agent  workflow  and

agent-to-agent interactions help to identify points of failure

•  Audit at regular intervals: This ensures that the system is performing as expected.

25

For an example of agent evaluation solutions, see AWS Labs, Agent Evaluation.

20

Monitoring and observability are not new concepts, but agents introduce some challenges. As
agents  execute  multiple  actions  at  machine  speed,  organisations  face  the  issue  of  extracting
meaningful insights from the voluminous logs generated by monitoring systems. This becomes more
difficult when high-risk anomalies are expected to be detected in real-time and surfaced as early as
possible.

Key considerations when setting up a monitoring system include:

•  What to log: Organisations should determine their objectives for monitoring (e.g. real-time
intervention, debugging, integration between components) to identify what to log. In doing
so,  prioritise  monitoring  for  high-risk  activities  such  as  updating  database  records  or
financial transactions.

•  How to effectively monitor logs: Organisations can consider approaches such as:

o  Defining alert thresholds:

▪  Programmatic,  threshold-based:  Define  alerts  when  agents  trigger
thresholds  e.g.  agent  attempts  unauthorised  access  or  makes  too  many
repeated tool calls within a specified timeframe.

▪  Outlier / anomaly detection: Use data science or deep learning techniques
to process agent signals and identify anomalous behaviour that may indicate
malfunctions.

▪  Agents monitoring other agents: Design agents to monitor other agents in

real-time, flagging any anomalies or inconsistencies.

o  Defining  specific  interventions:  For  each  alert  type,  consider  what  the  level  of
intervention  should  be.  Some  degree  of  human  review  should  be  incorporated,
proportionate to the risk level. For example, lower-priority alerts can be flagged for
review at a scheduled time, whereas higher-priority ones might require temporarily
halting  agent  execution  until  a  human  reviewer  can  assess.  In  the  event  of
catastrophic agentic malfunction or compromise, commensurate measures such as
termination and fallback solutions should be considered.

Finally, continuously test the agentic system even post-deployment to ensure that it works as
expected and is not affected by model drift or other changes in the environment.

21

2.4  Enable end-user responsibility

Ultimately, end users are the ones who use and rely on agents, and human accountability also
extends  to  these  users.  Organisations  should  provide  sufficient  information  to  end  users  to
promote trust and enable responsible use.

Organisations should consider:

•  Transparency: Users should be informed of the agents’ capabilities (e.g. scope of agent’s
access to user’s data, actions the agent can take) and the contact points whom users can
escalate to if the agent malfunctions.

•  Education: Users should be educated on proper use and oversight of agents (e.g. training
should be provided on an agent’s range of actions, common failure modes like hallucinations,
usage policies for data), as well as the potential loss of trade craft i.e. as agents take over
more  functions,  basic  operational  knowledge  could  be  eroded.  Hence  sufficient  training
(especially in areas where agents are prevalent) should be provided to ensure that humans
retain core skills.

2.4.1  Different users, different needs

Organisations should cater to different users with different information needs, to enable such
users  to  use  AI  responsibly.  Broadly,  there  are  two  main  archetypes  of  end-users  –  those  who
interact with agents, and those who integrate agents into their work processes or oversee them.

Users who interact with agents
e.g. customer service, HR agents –
mostly external-facing

Users who integrate agents into
their work processes
e.g. coding assistants, enterprise
workflows – mostly internal-facing

Focus on transparency

Layer on education and training

22

2.4.2  Users who interact with agents

Such users usually interact with agents that act on behalf of the organisation, e.g. customer
service or sales agents. These agents tend to be external facing, although they can also be deployed
within  the  organisation  e.g.  a  human  resource  agent  that  interacts  with  other  users  in  the
organisation.

For  these  users,  focus  on  transparency.  Organisations  should  share  pertinent  information  to
foster trust and facilitate proper usage of agents. Such information can include:

•  User’s responsibilities: Clearly define the user’s responsibilities, such as asking the user to

double-check all information provided by the agent.
Interaction: Declare upfront that the users are interacting with agents.

•
•  Agents’  range  of  actions  and  decisions:  Inform  the  users  on  the  range  of  actions  and

decisions that the agent is authorised to perform and make.

•  Data: Be clear on how user data is collected, stored, and used by the agents, in accordance
with the organisation's data privacy policies. Where necessary, obtain explicit consent from
users before collecting or using their data for the agents.

•  Human accountability and escalation: Provide users with the respective human contact
points who are responsible for the agents, whom the users can alert if the agents malfunction
or if they are dissatisfied with a decision.

2.4.3  Users who integrate agents into their work processes

Such  users  typically  utilise  agents  as  part  of  their  internal  workflows  e.g.  coding  assistants,
automation of enterprise processes. The agent acts for and on behalf of the user.

For these users, in addition to the information in the previous section, layer on education and
training so that users can use the agents responsibly. Key aspects include education and training
on:

•  Foundational knowledge on agents

o  Relevant use cases, so that the users understand how to best integrate the agents into
their  day-to-day  work,  and  the  scenarios  under  which  the  use  of  agents  should  be
restricted (e.g. do not use an agent for confidential data)
Instructing the agents e.g. general best practices in prompting, glossary of keywords to
elicit specific responses

o

o  Agents’ range of  actions, so  that the user  is aware  of their  capabilities and potential

impact

•  Effective oversight of agents

o  Common agent failure modes, such as hallucinations, getting stuck in loops after errors,

so that the user can identify and flag out issues.

o  Ongoing  support,  such  as  regular  refreshers  to  update  users  on  latest  features  and

common user mistakes

•  Potential impact on tradecraft

23

o  As agents take over entry level tasks, which typically serve as the training ground for new

staff, this could lead to loss of basic operational knowledge for the users.

o  Organisations should identify core capabilities of each job and provide sufficient training

and work exposure so that users retain foundational skills.

Call for feedback: This is a living document, and we invite suggestions on how the framework can
be updated or refined. The following questions can be used as a guide:

•

Introduction to Agentic AI: Are the descriptions of agentic AI systems accurate and
sufficiently comprehensive for readers to obtain a clear overview of the governance
challenges of agentic AI? Are there other risks that should be included?

•  Proposed Model Governance Framework: Are the four dimensions of the framework
practical and applicable? Are there any other dimensions that should be included? For
each dimension, are there specific governance and technical challenges and best
practices that should be included?
