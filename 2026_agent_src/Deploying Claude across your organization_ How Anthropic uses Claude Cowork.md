Foreword: The evolution
of AI at work

You lead a team that doesn't write code. The work is contracts, decks, financial

models, pipeline reviews, regulatory filings, executive reports. AI has been on

every board agenda for two years and while engineers at your company are

power users, most of your organization still uses it like a chatbot: ask a question,

get an answer, go do the work yourself.

The employees seeing real results are the ones that embed AI into how work

actually gets done. That means using AI that reads the same spreadsheets your

analysts read, drafting against the same templates your legal team uses, and

updating the same CRM your reps live in, then handing back finished work

rather than suggestions.

The trajectory has been fast. In 2024, using AI at work meant interfacing with

a chat window. In 2025, Claude Code put an agent at the command line and

developers started delegating hours of work at a time. In 2026, Claude Cowork

brings that same capability to the desktop for everyone else at your company:

the analysts, lawyers, account executives, product managers, marketers, and

more. And with plugins, skills, and commands, Claude becomes even more

customizable and capable.

This guide walks through how to deploy Claude Cowork across a business

function: where to start, how to structure a pilot, and best practices for scaling

what works. The examples come from Anthropic's own finance, legal, sales, and

product teams, alongside customers running Claude Cowork in production,

including Thomson Reuters, Zapier, and Jamf.

While the use cases are specific to Anthropic and other enterprises, the best

practices and patterns are not. We hope you find these lessons learned and best

practices applicable to your own workflows.

Introducing Claude Cowork

Until recently, most AI tools have been conversational: you ask it a question, it

Chat, Cowork, or Code: choosing the right Claude surface

provides an output in the context of a chat window.

Agents change that relationship. You describe an outcome, AI plans the steps,

executes them, and delivers something tangible across your files and tools.

While coding agents paved the way, functions beyond software engineering are

transforming their work by building specialized agents.

Lean how enterprises are building and using agents in our 2026 State of AI

Agents Report.

Powered by Claude, Claude Cowork is the product surface where this happens

for knowledge work, the way Claude Code is the agentic harness for developers.

It runs on your desktop and meets your work where it already lives: local files and

folders, connected cloud apps like Slack and Google Drive, and the browser via

Claude in Chrome. Claude can also work across Excel and PowerPoint, carrying

context from one to the other so an analysis and the deck that presents it happen

in a single session.

The difference between Claude Cowork and a chat window is agency. You don't

re-explain your brand voice, your data schema, or your approval process on

every turn. Claude holds that context across the task and moves between the

spreadsheet, the slides, and the memo the way a colleague would.

Get started with Claude Cowork today.

Claude Cowork is one of three ways to work with Claude in the desktop

app. Part of deploying it well is helping people know when to reach for it

and when one of the other two is the better fit.

Chat is for quick exchanges: exploring an idea, iterating on a paragraph,

getting an answer without leaving the app you're already in, and most of

your organization is already here. In-flow tasks include reading a dense PDF

and asking for the one-sentence takeaway, sanity-checking a claim ahead of

a meeting, or making sense of a long Slack thread you walked into cold.

Cowork is for knowledge work that takes real effort: pulling information

from many sources, making sense of it, and producing something finished

like a document, deck, or spreadsheet. Folder access, enterprise connectors,

browser, scheduled tasks, plugins. When the output is a deliverable rather

than an answer, this is the surface.The projects Cowork excels at include

turning a folder of customer interview transcripts into a themed findings

doc, building a competitive landscape from a dozen vendor sites and their

recent announcements, or a scheduled Friday-morning task (for instance, a

weekly revenue report) that pulls metrics from connected tools and drops a

formatted brief into a shared folder.

Code is the full development environment for engineers: direct codebase

access, plan and code modes, visual diffs, git integration, local or remote

environments. It's where your developers already live, and Claude Cowork

doesn't try to replace it. Examples include shipping a feature across a multi-

service codebase with tests, building a web application, or migrating legacy

code.

Why Claude Cowork

For business leaders, the value of Claude Cowork shows up in four places.

Speed

stops being tribal knowledge and becomes organizational infrastructure. Claude

Cwork allows organizations to tackle complex, multi-step tasks at scale, across

teams. The playbook your top AE uses to prep for renewals, the checklist your

senior counsel runs on every MSA, and the format your RevOps lead built for

pipeline reviews become encoded in your organizational workflows, allowing

every person on the team to work with the same context and processes.

Consistency improves because everyone runs the same playbook, and the

playbook itself compounds as the team refines it.

Capacity for work you weren't doing

The more interesting effect of Claude Cowork is the work that wasn't happening

at all because nobody had time to do it: the regulatory monitoring your legal

team wanted to do across forty jurisdictions but couldn't staff, the per-account

dashboards your sales managers wanted but couldn't get engineering cycles for,

or the quarterly competitive sweep marketing always meant to run. This is where

functional leads tend to see the biggest return—not doing the same work faster,

but doing the work that mattered but was never a P0.

With Claude Cowork, work that took hours compresses into minutes. Call prep

that took thirty minutes of digging through CRM notes, email threads, and call

recordings takes two. A first-pass contract review that blocked a deal for a week

•  Skills are encoded workflows (markdown files) that tell Claude how your

team does something. A variance analysis skill knows which tables to query,

what to compare against, and how your CFO likes the output formatted. A

morning briefing skill knows to pull today's calendar, check your priority deals,

and surface the three things that need attention before 9am. Skills can be

invoked directly via slash commands or triggered automatically when Claude

recognizes they're relevant.

•  Subagents are autonomous workflows Claude runs end to end without

you watching: an agent that monitors regulatory filings across jurisdictions

and flags what's material to your business, or one that checks your book of

accounts for untracked revenue every Friday.

•  Connectors are two-way integrations built on MCP (Model Context Protocol,

a universal standard for connecting AI applications to external data and tools)

that let Claude read from and write to the systems your team already uses,

including Salesforce, Slack, BigQuery, Docusign, Jira, Google Workspace, and

a growing directory of others. Connectors respect your existing permissions;

Claude sees what the user sees.

version-controllable, and editable by anyone who can write a how-to doc. You

don't need an engineering team to build one. Anthropic's own Legal plugin

was built by a product lawyer in an afternoon by pointing Claude at the team's

existing memos, risk frameworks, and policy documents.

Thomson Reuters: Moving judgment up the stack

Thomson Reuters piloted Claude Cowork with Claude Enterprise across

teams that don't typically build software. The pattern they saw: non-

developers moving further into automation and light prototyping using

documents and data they already work with every day. The skeptics

converted not after a demo but after a couple hours of running real

workflows.

"Claude Cowork helps teams do work at a scale that was hard to justify

before. The human role becomes validation, refinement, and decision-

making. Not repetitive rework." — Joel Hron, CTO, Thomson Reuters

whatever system holds the queue, and ask it to categorize the work and tell you

there.

In levels terms, the goal of this phase is modest: get a handful of people from

Level 0 (asking Claude questions) to Level 1 (handing Claude a real folder

of work and getting a finished deliverable back). You're not building skills or

plugins yet; you're finding the two or three workflows where a Level 1 win is

where the time goes. This is itself a Level 1 task, and a useful one: Anthropic's

Choosing your first use case

Good pilot candidates fall into one or a few of these categories:

•  High volume, high repetition. Work that happens dozens of times a week

and follows a knowable pattern, like meeting prep docs or data pulls.

•  Information-dense synthesis. Anywhere a human is spending time being

the integration layer between systems, including pipeline reviews, regulatory

monitoring, and quarterly financial reports.

•  Bottleneck-creating work. Speeding up cross-functional work (i.e., legal

reviews of marketing blogs or creative briefs) doesn't save one person time; it

unblocks everyone downstream.

•  Expertise-dependent but process-driven. Business reviews, specialized

recruiting screens, or product briefs–in other words, the work only your best

people do well today, because they've internalized a process nobody wrote

down–fit the bill. This category pays back the most: encode that process in a

number they need.

patterns and best practices applicable to your own organizations.

The impact

Finance and strategy

The problem

Financial analysis at Anthropic requires deep knowledge of data warehouse

schemas, complex SQL, and front-end engineering cycles the team didn't have.

Dashboard builds took weeks. Alerts surfaced raw metrics with no context:

"revenue down 3%" instead of "revenue down 3% driven by a dip in APAC

Development velocity moved from weeks to hours. Non-technical team

members build interactive dashboards without filing a ticket. One account

momentum indicators, drill-downs, that he uses multiple times a day. His

manager now uses it to look across every rep on her team.

Alerts got useful, too. When a metric moves, Claude pulls the context and

surfaces the likely driver alongside the number. The conversation moves from

"what happened"? to "what do we do about it?"

how to interpret them lived in two or three people's heads.

The approach

Legal

The team's first step was connecting Claude Cowork to the data warehouse via

The problem

MCP and asking ad-hoc questions against live data. The jump to building skills

was encoding the four queries they kept re-running as skills: an insight agent

for ad-hoc questions, a financial statements skill that produces standard reports,

a variance analysis skill that explains deltas rather than only flagging them,

and a dashboard builder that generates interactive HTML dashboards from a

description of what you want to see.

Legal is information-dense, high-stakes, and chronically bottlenecked.

Throughput work, including regulatory monitoring across jurisdictions, internal

comms, and ticket triage, consumed hours better spent on judgment calls and

complex legal questions. Before Claude, the team's institutional knowledge lived

in memos, risk frameworks, and a policy wiki most people hadn't read in full.

17

The approach

The team built the Legal plugin in an afternoon, not by coding anything, but by

pointing Claude at their actual work product: the memos, the risk frameworks,

the policy docs. The plugin is markdown files that tell Claude how Anthropic's

legal team thinks about risk, reviews launches, and structures advice.

As Pike describes it, the project is recursive: he used Claude to build the plugin,

and now uses the plugin every day to do his actual job. The plugin is open-

source on GitHub alongside the other knowledge-work plugins, because there's

nothing proprietary about it. It's system instructions, not case law.

Legal is the clearest example in the company of skipping rungs of the Claude

Cowork adoption ladder. Because the team's process was already written down

in memos and frameworks, Pike could "here's our policy folder, draft this launch

review" to a department plugin in a single afternoon.

The impact

The Anthropic legal team saw the immediate returns when adopting Claude

Cowork.Regulatory monitoring across dozens of jurisdictions went from reading

Sales

The problem

Reps spent more time documenting work than doing it. The context for any

given account lives in Salesforce, email, Gong recordings, Slack, and somebody's

memory, and before every call, someone has to reassemble it. Thirty minutes

of prep for a call you might get fifteen minutes of useful conversation out of,

multiplied across a book of hundreds of accounts.

The approach

The sales plugin encodes how the team's best sellers work as five skills: a

morning briefing that organizes the day, call prep that pulls the full account

context into one brief, post-call follow-up that drafts the email and updates the

opportunity, competitive intelligence that tracks what's moving in the market,

and asset creation that generates custom collateral on demand.

These Claude Cowork-powered systems surface information to the rep rather

than requiring the rep to go find it.

everything and hoping you catch what matters to reading what Claude flagged

and deciding. The team reads what's material instead of triaging the full feed.

The impact

Biweekly legal updates for the executive team used to take the better part of

a day to compile. Now they take a fraction of that, because Claude does the

synthesis across intake tickets, Slack threads, and matter status before anyone

opens a doc.

And the team pointed Claude at 742 Jira tickets, the full legal intake backlog, and

asked what the work actually looked like. The analysis reshaped how the team

structures intake: which categories can be templated, which need a human from

the start, and where the queue was backing up and why.

The plugin is generic out of the box and gets good when customized. The version

Anthropic Legal runs internally has the team's playbooks, risk frameworks, and

what they call the Legal Constitution baked in.

The morning briefing organizes the day in about two minutes: today's calls,

which deals need attention, what changed overnight. Call prep that took thirty

minutes of manual research happens in the background while you're on the

previous call.

One rep built a skill that auto-updates Salesforce opportunities after calls: Claude

takes the call context, fills in every required field, and writes the description, use

cases, notes, and next steps, formatted the way he wants them. He started with a

validation step on every update. After enough manual checks confirmed Claude

was getting it right, he removed the validation and lets it run. That progression,

run it supervised, then run it scheduled, is the Level 2 to Level 3 move, and it

saves hours per week.

hundreds of Salesforce records, the kind of fix that would otherwise be a painful

manual afternoon or a ticket to ops.

Product management

The problem

Product management work spans dozens of activities daily and most of it

happens in meetings. The failure mode is things slipping through the cracks: a

decision made in a meeting that nobody wrote down, a customer insight from

a sales call that never made it into the PRD. Before Claude Cowork, Claude

couldn't help with the core PM work, strategy, roadmaps, PRDs, because it lacked

the organizational context to say anything useful.

The approach

The biggest unlock for PMs was plugin stacking. Rather than one PM plugin, the

team layers several: the productivity plugin for personal context and calendar,

the data plugin for live analytics, the sales plugin for customer insights from calls

and tickets, and the product plugin for PRD structure and roadmap methodology.

Individually, each plugin is useful. Stacked, Claude has org context, real usage

data, actual customer quotes, and a framework for turning all of it into a PRD, at

the same time, in the same session.

The impact

PRDs get written from real data and customer context rather than generic

templates. Claude pulls the usage numbers, surfaces the relevant customer

Leveling up with Claude Cowork

Across very different companies and teams at Anthropic, the arc was the same:

connect Claude to real work, get one deliverable back, encode what worked as a

skill, bundle and share it.

You don't need every employee using the same plugins to call a deployment

successful. You need every employee more productive than they are today, and a

clear path to the next rung of the adoption ladder. Connecting the systems to get

real work done is possible on day one. Give champions room to build, and then

provision their work so everyone after them has a leg up.

The teams in this guide didn't transform how they work in a single step. They

each took one, then kept going.
